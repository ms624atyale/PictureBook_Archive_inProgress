  will they double my load,   or my blows? then, by goad, and by stirrup, i've no cause to go.  your reasons are not mine     the fox & the mosquitoes     being plagued with mosquitoes one day, said old fox, pray don't send them away,   for a hungrier swarm   would work me more harm; i had rather the full ones should stay.  there were politicians in Ã¦sop's time     the fox & the lion   the first time the fox had a sight of the lion, he 'most died of fright;   when he next met his eye,   fox felt just a bit shy; but the next--quite at ease, & polite.  familiarity destroys fear     the miser & his gold     he buried his gold in a hole. one saw, and the treasure he stole.   said another, what matter?   don't raise such a clatter, you can still go & sit by the hole.  use alone gives value     the golden eggs   a golden egg, one every day, that simpleton's goose used to lay;   so he killed the poor thing,   swifter fortune to bring, and dined off his fortune that day.  greed overeaches itself  [transcriber's note: 'overeaches' should be 'overreaches']     the man that pleased none     through the town this good man & his son strove to ride as to please everyone:   self, son, or both tried,   then the ass had a ride; while the world, at their efforts, poked fun.  you cannot hope to please all--don't try     the oak & the reeds     giant oak, in his strength & his scorn of the winds, by the roots was uptorn:   but slim reeds at his side,   the fierce gale did outride, since, by bending the burden was borne.  bend, not break     the fir & the bramble   the fir-tree looked down on the bramble. poor thing, only able to scramble   about on the ground.   just then an axe' sound made the fir wish himself but a bramble.  pride of place has its disadvantages     the trees & the woodman     the trees ask of man what he lacks; one bit, just to handle my axe?   all he asks--well and good:   but he cuts down the wood, so well does he handle his axe!  give me an inch & i'll take an ell     the hart & the vine     a hart by the hunters pursued, safely hid in a vine, till he chewed   the sweet tender green,   and, through shaking leaves seen, he was slain by his ingratitude.  spare your benefactors     the man & the snake     in pity he brought the poor snake to be warmed at his fire. a mistake!   for the ungrateful thing   wife & children would sting. i have known some as bad as the snake.  beware how you entertain traitors     the fox & the mask     a fox with his foot on a mask, thus took the fair semblance to task;   you're a real handsome face;   but what part of your case are your brains in, good sir! let me ask?  masks are the faces of shams     the ass in the lion's skin     what pranks i shall play! thought the ass, in this skin for a lion to pass;   but he left one ear out,   and a hiding, no doubt, lion had--on the skin of an ass!  imposters generally forget something     the lion & the statve     on a statue--king lion dethroned, showing conqueror man,--lion frowned.   if a lion, you know,   had been sculptor, he'd show lion rampant, and man on the ground.  the story depends on the teller     the boaster     in the house, in the market, the streets, everywhere he was boasting his feats;   till one said, with a sneer,   let us see it done here! what's so oft done with ease, one repeats.  deeds not words     the vain jackdaw     fine feathers, jack thought, make fine fowls; i'll be envied of bats & of owls:   but the peacocks' proud eyes   saw through his disguise, and jack fled the assembly of fowls.  borrowed plumes are soon discovered     the peacock's complaint     the peacock considered it wrong that he had not the nightingale's song;   so to juno he went,   she replied, be content with thy having, & hold thy fool's tongue!  do not quarrel with nature     the two jars     never fear! said the brass to the clay of two jars that the flood bore away:   keep you close to my side!   but the porcelain replied, i'll be smashed if beside you i stay.  our friend our enemy     the two crabs   so awkward, so shambling a gait! mrs crab did her daughter berate,   who rejoined, it is true   i am backward; but you needed lessons in walking quite late.  look at home     brother & sister     twin children: the girl, she was plain; the brother was handsome & vain;   let him brag of his looks,   father said; mind your books! the best beauty is bred in the brain.  handsome is as handsome does     the fox without a tail     said fox, minus tail in a trap, my friends! here's a lucky mishap:   give your tails a short lease!   but the foxes weren't geese, and none followed the fashion of trap.  yet some fashions have no better reason     the dog & the shadow     his image the dog did not know, or his bone's, in the pond's painted show:   t'other dog, so he thought   has got more than he ought, so he snapped, & his dinner saw go!  greed is sometimes caught by its own bait     the crow & the pitcher     how the cunning old crow got his drink when 'twas low in the pitcher, just think!   don't say that he spilled it!   with pebbles he filled it, till the water rose up to the brink.  use your wits     the eagle and the crow  the eagle flew off with a lamb; then the crow thought to lift an old ram,   in his eaglish conceit,   the wool tangled his feet, and the shepherd laid hold of the sham.  beware of overrating your own powers     the blind doe     a poor half-blind doe her one eye kept shoreward, all danger to spy,   as she fed by the sea,   poor innocent! she was shot from a boat passing by.  watch on all sides     the geese & the cranes     the geese joined the cranes in some wheat; all was well, till, disturbed at their treat,   light-winged, the cranes fled,   but the slow geese, well fed, couldn't rise, and were caught in retreat.  beware of enterprizes where the risks are not equal     the trumpeter taken prisoner     a trumpeter, prisoner made, hoped his life would be spared when he said   he'd no part in the fight,   but they answered him--right, but what of the music you made?  songs may serve a cause as well as swords     hot and cold     when to warm his cold fingers man blew, and again, but to cool the hot stew;   simple satyr, unused   to man's ways, felt confused, when the same mouth blew hot & cold too!  Ã¦sop aimed at double dealing     neither beast nor bird     a beast he would be, or a bird, as might suit, thought the bat: but he erred.   when the battle was done,   he found that no one would take him for friend at his word.  between two stools you may come to the ground     the stag in the ox stall     safe enough lay the poor hunted deer in the ox-stall, with nothing to fear   from the careless-eyed men:   till the master came; then there was no hiding-place for the deer.  an eye is keen in its own interest     the deer & the lion   from the hounds the swift deer sped away, to his cave, where in past times he lay   well concealed; unaware   of a lion couched there, for a spring that soon made him his prey.  fate can meet as well as follow     the lion in love     though the lion in love let them draw all his teeth, and pare down every claw,   he'd no bride for his pains,   for they beat out his brains ere he set on his maiden a paw.  our very means may defeat our ends     the cat and venus     might his cat be a woman, he said: venus changed her: the couple were wed:   but a mouse in her sight   metamorphosed her quite, and for bride, a cat found he instead.  nature will out     mice in council   against cat sat a council of mice. every mouse came out prompt with advice;   and a bell on cat's throat   would have met a round vote, had the bell-hanger not been so nice.  the best policy often turns on an if     the hen and the fox     the hen roosted high on her perch; hungry fox down below, on the search,   coaxed her hard to descend   she replied, most dear friend! i feel more secure on my perch.  beware of interested friendships     the cat and the fox   the fox said i can play, when it fits, many wiles that with man make me quits.   but my trick's up a tree!   said the cat, safe to see clever fox hunted out of his wits.  trust to skill rather than wit     the hare and the tortoise     'twas a race between tortoise and hare, puss was sure she'd so much time to spare,   that she lay down to sleep,   and let old thick-shell creep to the winning post first!--you may stare.  persistence beats impulse     the hares and the frogs   timid hares, from the trumpeting wind, fled as swift as the fear in their mind;   till in fright from their fear,   from the green sedges near, leaping frogs left their terror behind.  our own are not the only troubles     porcupine, snake, & company     going shares with the snakes, porcupine said--the best of the bargain is mine:   nor would he back down,   when the snake would disown the agreement his quills made them sign.  hasty partnerships may be repented of     the bear & the bees   their honey i'll have when i please; who cares for such small things as bees?   said the bear; but the stings   of these very small things left him not very much at his ease.  the weakest united may be strong to avenge     the bundle of sticks     to his sons, who fell out, father spake: this bundle of sticks you can't break;   take them singly, with ease,   you may break as you please, so, dissension your strength will unmake.  strength is in unity     the farmer's treasure     dig deeply, my sons! through this field! there's a treasure--he died: unrevealed   the spot where 'twas laid,   they dug as he bade; and the treasure was found in the yield.  productive labour is the only source of wealth     the cock, the ass & the lion     the ass gave a horrible bray, cock crowed; lion scampered away;   ass judged he was scared   by the bray, and so dared to pursue; lion ate him they say.  don't take all the credit to yourself     the ass and the lap dog   how master that little dog pets! thinks the ass; & with jealousy frets,   so he climbs master's knees,   hoping dog-like to please, and a drubbing is all that he gets.  asses must not expect to be fondled     fortvne and the boy     a boy heedless slept by the well by dame fortune awaked, truth to tell,   said she, hadst been drowned,   'twould have surely been found this by fortune, not folly befel.  fortune is not answerable for our want of foresight     the ungrateful wolf     to the wolf, from whose throat dr crane drew the bone, his long bill made it plain   he expected his fee:   snarled wolf--fiddle de dee, be thankful your head's out again.  some characters have no sense of obligation     the fisherman & the fish   prayed the fish, as the fisherman took him, a poor little mite, from his hook,   let me go! i'm so small.   he replied, not at all! you're the biggest, perhaps in the brook.  a little certainty is better than a great chance     the herdsman's vows     a kid vowed to jove, so might he find his herd, & his herd did he see   soon, of lions the prey:   then 'twas--get me away, and a goat of the best take for fee.  how often would we mend our wishes!     the horse and the ass   overladen the ass was. the horse wouldn't help; but had time for remorse   when the ass lay dead there;   for he then had to bear both the load of the ass & his corse.  grudge not help!     the ass & the sick lion     crafty lion,--perhaps with the gout, kept his cave; where, to solve any doubt,   many visitors go:   but the ass, he said no! they go in, but i've seen none come out.  reason from results""",baby's own Ã¦sop's fables,walter crane 
3,"the old english garden  a floral phantasy         in an old world garden dreaming,   where the flowers had human names,   methought, in fantastic seeming,   they disported as squires and dames.      of old in rosamond's bower,   with it's peacock hedges of yew,   one could never find the flower   unless one was given the clue;   so take the key of the wicket,   who would follow my fancy free,   by formal knot and clipt thicket,   and smooth greensward so fair to see      and while time his scythe is whetting,   ere the dew from the grass has gone,      the four seasons' flight forgetting,   as they dance round the dial stone;      with a leaf from an old english book,   a jonquil will serve for a pen.      let us note from the green arbour's nook,   flowers masking like women and men.      first in venus's looking glass,   you may see where love lies bleeding,      while pretty maids all of them pass   with careless hearts quite unheeding.      next, a knight with his flaming targe   see the dent-de-lion so bold   with his feathery crest at large,   on a field of the cloth of gold.      simple honesty shows in vain   a fashion few seek to robe in,   while the poor shepherd's-purse is ta'en   by rascally ragged-robin.      coltsfoot   and   larkspur    speedwell      in the race of the flowers that's run due,      as the hartstongue pants at the well      and the houndstongue laps the sundew.      here's venus'-combe for maidenhair:   while king-cups drink bella-donna,      glad in purple and gold so fair,   though the deadly nightshade's upon her.      behold london pride robed & crowned,   ushered in by the golden rod,   while a floral crowd press around,   just to win from her crest a nod.      the foxgloves are already on.   not only in pairs but dozens;   they've come out to see all the fun,   with sisters and aunts and cousins.      the stitchwork looked up with a sigh   at batchelor's buttons unsewn:      single daisies were not in her eye,   for the grass was just newly mown.      the horse-tail, 'scaped from wolfe's claw,   rides off with a ladies' lages.      the friar's-cowl hides a doctor of law,   and the bishop's-weed covers his grace's      the snapdragon opened his jaw,   but, at sight of scotch thistle, turned pale:      he'd too many points of the law   for a dragon without a scale.      little jenny-creeper lay low,   till happy thoughts made her gladder;   how to rise in the world she'd know,   so she climbed up jacob's ladder      sweet william with marygold   seek heartsease in the close box-border.   where, starched in their ruff's stiff fold,   dutch dahlias prim, keep order.      narcissus bends over the brook,   intent upon daffa-down-dilly:      while eyebright observes from her nook,   and wonders he could be so silly.      a lance for a lad 'gainst king's spear.   when the bugle sounds for the play      a ladies mantle flaunting there   is the banner that leads the fray.      knight's spur to the ladies bower   to seek for the ladies slipper.      'twas lost in the wood in a summer shower   when the clown's wort tried to trip her.      toad-flax is spun for butter-and-eggs      on a ladies' cushion sits thrift   she never wastes, or steals, or begs,   but she can't give poor ragwort a lift.      queen of the meads is meadowsweet,   in the realm of grasses wide:      but not in all her court you meet   the turbaned turk's head in his pride.      fair bethlehem' star shineth bright,   in a lowly place, as of old,      and through the green gloom glows the light   of st. john's-wort--a nimbus of gold.      but the hours of the sun swift glide,   and the flowers with them are speeding.      though love-in-a-mist may hide.   when time's in the garden weeding.      there's traveller's joy   to entwine,   at our journey's end for greeting,      we can talk over sops-in-wine,   and drink to our next merry meeting.      printed   by   edmund   evans    bound   by   leighton   son &   hodge      [illustration: a floral fantasy]",a floral fantasy in an old english garden,walter crane
