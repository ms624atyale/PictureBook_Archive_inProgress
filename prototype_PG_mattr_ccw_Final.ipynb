 eggs and butter and cake, mr. wolf.  where are you going with them, little red riding hood?  i am going to my grandmother, who is ill, mr. wolf.  where does your grandmother live, little red riding hood?  along that path, past the wild rose bushes, then through the gate at the end of the wood, mr. wolf.  then mr. wolf again said good morning and set off, and little red riding hood again went in search of wild flowers.  at last he reached the porch covered with flowers and knocked at the door of the cottage.  who is there? called the grandmother.  little red riding hood, said the wicked wolf.  press the latch, open the door, and walk in, said the grandmother.  the wolf pressed the latch, and walked in where the grandmother lay in bed. he made one jump at her, but she jumped out of bed into a closet. then the wolf put on the cap which she had dropped and crept under the bedclothes.  in a short while little red riding hood knocked at the door, and walked in, saying, good morning, grandmother, i have brought you eggs, butter and cake, and here is a bunch of flowers i gathered in the wood. as she came nearer the bed she said, what big ears you have, grandmother.  all the better to hear you with, my dear.  what big eyes you have, grandmother.  all the better to see you with, my dear.  but, grandmother, what a big nose you have.  all the better to smell with, my dear.  but, grandmother, what a big mouth you have.  all the better to eat you up with, my dear, he said as he sprang at little red riding hood.  just at that moment little red riding hood's father was passing the cottage and heard her scream. he rushed in and with his axe chopped off mr. wolf's head.  everybody was happy that little red riding hood had escaped the wolf. then little red riding hood's father carried her home and they lived happily ever after.     the goose-girl   there was once an old queen who had a very beautiful daughter. the time came when the maiden was to go into a distant country to be married. the old queen packed up everything suitable to a royal outfit.  she also sent a waiting-woman with her. when the hour of departure came they bade each other a sorrowful farewell and set out for the bridegroom's country.  when they had ridden for a time the princess became very thirsty, and said to the waiting-woman, go down and fetch me some water in my cup from the stream. i must have something to drink.  if you are thirsty, said the waiting-woman, dismount yourself, lie down by the water and drink. i don't choose to be your servant.  being very thirsty, the princess dismounted, and knelt by the flowing water.  now, when she was about to mount her horse again, the waiting-woman said, by rights your horse belongs to me; this jade will do for you!  the poor little princess was obliged to give way. then the waiting-woman, in a harsh voice, ordered her to take off her royal robes, and to put on her own mean garments. finally she forced her to swear that she would not tell a person at the court what had taken place. had she not taken the oath she would have been killed on the spot.  there was great rejoicing when they arrived at the castle. the prince hurried towards them, and lifted the waiting-woman from her horse, thinking she was his bride. she was led upstairs, but the real princess had to stay below.  the old king looked out of the window and saw the delicate, pretty little creature standing in the courtyard; so he asked the bride about her companion.  i picked her up on the way, and brought her with me for company. give the girl something to do to keep her from idling.  the old king said, i have a little lad who looks after the geese; she may help him.  the boy was called little conrad, and the real bride was sent with him to look after the geese. when they reached the meadow, the princess sat down on the grass and let down her hair, and when conrad saw it he was so delighted that he wanted to pluck some out; but she said--    blow, blow, little breeze,   and conrad's hat seize.   let him join in the chase   while away it is whirled,   till my tresses are curled   and i rest in my place.  then a strong wind sprang up, which blew away conrad's hat right over the fields, and he had to run after it. when he came back her hair was all put up again.  when they got home conrad went to the king and said, i won't tend the geese with that maiden again.  why not? asked the king.  then conrad went on to tell the king all that had happened in the field. the king ordered conrad to go next day as usual and he followed into the field and hid behind a bush. he saw it happen just as conrad had told him. thereupon he went away unnoticed; and in the evening, when the goose-girl came home, he asked her why she did all these things.  that i may not tell you, she answered.  then he said, if you won't tell me, then tell the iron stove there; and he went away.  she crept up to the stove and unburdened her heart to it. the king stood outside by the pipes of the stove and heard all she said. then he came back, and caused royal robes to be put upon her, and her beauty was a marvel. then he called his son and told him that he had a false bride, but that the true bride was here.  the prince was charmed with her beauty and a great banquet was prepared. the bridegroom sat at the head of the table, with the princess on one side and the waiting-woman at the other; but she did not recognize the princess.  when they had eaten, the king put a riddle to the waiting-woman. what does a person deserve that deceives his master? telling the whole story.  the false bride answered, he must be put into a barrel and dragged along by two white horses till he is dead.  that is your doom, said the king, and the judgment shall be carried out.  when the sentence was fulfilled, the young prince married his true bride, and they lived together in peace and happiness.     babes in the wood   once upon a time there lived two little children whose parents were ill unto death. they begged their brother to care for the two little ones as he would his own.  the uncle promised he would be a father to them, but he soon began to scheme to possess the money the parents had left in his care for the children. he sent for two robbers and bargained with them to take the two babes into the woods and kill them.  after going many miles into the woods one of the robbers said, let us not kill the little children, they never harmed us. the other robber would not consent, so they came to blows. this frightened the children so much that they ran away and did not see the robbers again.  they wandered on and on until they became so tired and hungry that at length they sat down at the foot of a tree and cried as if their hearts would break. the little birds heard them and began to trill sweet lullabies, which presently lulled them to rest.  the birdies knew that the children would die of cold and hunger, so they covered them with leaves of crimson and brown and green. they then told the angels in heaven the sad story of the lost babes, and one of the white-robed angels flew down to earth and carried both the little ones back to heaven, so that when they awoke they were no longer tired and hungry, but were again with their dear mother.     the sleeping beauty   once upon a time there was a king and queen who for a very long time had no children, and when at length a little daughter was born to them they were so pleased that they gave a christening feast to which they invited a number of fairies. but, unfortunately, they left out one rather cross old fairy, and she was so angry that she said the princess should die when she reached the age of sixteen, by pricking her hand with a spindle.  all the other fairies present, except one, had already given the princess their beautiful gifts, and this last one said she could not prevent part of the wicked wish coming true; but her gift should be that the princess should not really die, but only fall into a deep sleep, which should last for a hundred years, and at the end of that time she should be awakened by a king's son.  it all happened as the fairies had predicted. when the princess was sixteen years old she saw an old woman spinning and took the spindle from her to try this strange new work. instantly she pricked her hand and fell into a deep sleep, as did everyone else in the palace. there she lay in a bower of roses, year after year, and the hedge around the palace garden grew so tall and thick that at last you could not have told that there was a castle at all.  at the end of the hundred years a king's son heard of the castle and the enchanted princess who lay asleep there and determined to rescue her. so he cut his way through the thick prickly hedge and at length he came to the princess. when he saw how lovely and how sweet she looked he fell in love with her and, stooping, kissed her lips.  at once she awoke and with her the king and queen and all the courtiers, who had fallen asleep at the same time.  as the princess was as much taken with the prince's appearance as he was with hers, they decided to be married. and so the wedding was celebrated the same day with great pomp and ceremony.     snowdrop and seven little dwarfs   once upon a time there was a little princess called snowdrop, who had a cruel step-mother who was jealous of her. the queen had a magic mirror, which could speak to her, and when she looked into it and asked who was the fairest lady in the land the mirror told her she was, for she was very beautiful; but as snowdrop grew up she became still more lovely than her step-mother and the mirror did not fail to tell the queen this.  so she ordered one of her huntsmen to take snowdrop away and kill her; but he was too tender-hearted to do this and left the maiden in the wood and went home again. snowdrop wandered about until she came to the house of seven little dwarfs, and they were so kind as to take her in and let her live with them. she used to make their seven little beds, and prepare the meals for the seven little men, and they were all quite happy until the queen found out from her mirror that snowdrop was alive still, for, as it always told the truth, it still told her snowdrop was the fairest lady in the land.  she decided that snowdrop must die, so she dyed her face and dressed up like an old pedlar, and in this disguise she went to the home of the seven dwarfs and called out, laces for sale.  snowdrop peeped out of the window and said, good-day, mother; what have you to sell?  good laces, fine laces, laces of every color, and she held out one that was made of gay silk.  snowdrop opened the door and bought the pretty lace.  child, said the old woman, you are a sight, let me lace you properly for once.  snowdrop placed herself before the old woman, who laced her so quickly and so tightly that she took away snowdrop's breath and she fell down as though dead.  not long after the seven dwarfs came home they found that she was laced too tight and cut the lace, whereupon snowdrop began to breathe and soon came back to life again.  when the queen got home and found by asking her mirror that snowdrop was still alive, she planned to make an end of her for good, so she made a poisoned comb and disguised herself to look like a different old woman.  she journeyed to the dwarfs' home and induced snowdrop to let her comb her hair. the minute she put the poisoned comb in her hair snowdrop fell down as though dead.  when the seven dwarfs came home they found their poor snowdrop on the floor, and suspecting the bad queen began to look for the cause, soon finding the comb. no sooner had they removed it than snowdrop came to life again.  upon the queen's return home she found by asking her mirror that snowdrop still lived, so she disguised herself a third time and came to the dwarfs' little house and gave snowdrop a poisoned apple. as soon as the little princess took a bite it stuck in her throat and choked her.  oh! how grieved were the good little dwarfs. they made a fine glass coffin, and put snowdrop into it and were carrying her away to bury her when they met a prince, who fell in love with the little dead maiden, and begged the dwarfs to give her to him.  the dwarfs were so sorry for him they consented, and the prince's servants were about to carry the coffin away when they stumbled and fell over the root of a tree. snowdrop received such a violent jerk that the poisonous apple was jerked right out of her throat and she sat up alive and well again.  of course she married the prince, and she, her husband and the good little dwarfs lived happily ever after, but the cruel step-mother came to a bad end, and no one was even sorry for her.\",\n          \"one morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.  he pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.  a gig was coming along the road; it was driven by mr. mcgregor, and beside him sat mrs. mcgregor in her best bonnet.  as soon as they had passed, little benjamin bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of mr. mcgregor's garden.      that wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived benjamin's aunt and his cousins--flopsy, mopsy, cotton-tail, and peter.  old mrs. rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (i once bought a pair at a bazaar). she also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).  little benjamin did not very much want to see his aunt.  he came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin peter.      peter was sitting by himself. he looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.  peter, said little benjamin, in a whisper, who has got your clothes?  peter replied, the scarecrow in mr. mcgregor's garden, and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.  little benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that mr. mcgregor had gone out in a gig, and mrs. mcgregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.      peter said he hoped that it would rain.  at this point old mrs. rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: cotton-tail! cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!  peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.  they went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. from here they looked down into mr. mcgregor's garden. peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of mr. mcgregor's.      little benjamin said: it spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.  peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.  it had been sown with lettuces.  they left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little benjamin, who was wearing clogs.      little benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.  they took them off the scarecrow. there had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.  benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.  then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his aunt.  peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.       benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. he said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their sunday dinner.  (the name of little benjamin's papa was old mr. benjamin bunny.)  the lettuces certainly were very fine.  peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. presently he dropped half the onions.      little benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. he led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. they went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.  the mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at peter rabbit and little benjamin bunny.  presently peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.      they got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!  he was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.  this is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!  little benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and peter and the onions underneath a large basket....      the cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.  perhaps she liked the smell of onions!  anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.  she sat there for five hours.                                       i cannot draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry.  the sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.      at length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.  the cat looked up and saw old mr. benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.  he was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.  he was looking for his son.  old mr. bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.  he took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.  the cat was too much surprised to scratch back.      when old mr. bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.  then he came back to the basket and took out his son benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.  then he took out his nephew peter.  then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.    when mr. mcgregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.  it looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!  also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse, locking the door upon the outside.      when peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. cotton-tail and peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old mrs. rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco. a farmyard tale     for     ralph and betsy      what a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!  --listen to the story of jemima puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.    her sister-in-law, mrs. rebeccah puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else--i have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, jemima. you would let them go cold; you know you would!  i wish to hatch my own eggs; i will hatch them all by myself, quacked jemima puddle-duck.    she tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.  jemima puddle-duck became quite desperate. she determined to make a nest right away from the farm.    she set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill.  she was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.    when she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.  she thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.    jemima puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. she ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.    she flew beautifully when she had got a good start.  she skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.    jemima alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place. she rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves.  but--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.  he had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.  quack? said jemima puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side--quack?    the gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at jemima--  madam, have you lost your way? said he. he had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.  jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. she explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place.    ah! is that so? indeed! said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at jemima. he folded up the newspaper, and put it in his coat-tail pocket.  jemima complained of the superfluous hen.  indeed! how interesting! i wish i could meet with that fowl. i would teach it to mind its own business!    but as to a nest--there is no difficulty: i have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. no, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. you may sit there as long as you like, said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.  he led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves.  it was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.    this is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient, said the hospitable gentleman.  there was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes. the gentleman opened the door, and showed jemima in.    the shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.  jemima puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. but it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.    when she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.  he was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let jemima go home for the night. he promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day.  he said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed.    jemima puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. they were greeny white and very large. the foxy gentleman admired them immensely. he used to turn them over and count them when jemima was not there.  at last jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--and i will bring a bag of corn with me, so that i need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. they might catch cold, said the conscientious jemima.    madam, i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; i will provide oats. but before you commence your tedious sitting, i intend to give you a treat. let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!  may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. i will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelette, said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.    jemima puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.  she went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.    and she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.  the collie-dog kep met her coming out, what are you doing with those onions? where do you go every afternoon by yourself, jemima puddle-duck?  jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.  the collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.    he asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed.  then he went out, and trotted down the village. he went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.    jemima puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. she was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.  she flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.    he was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. when jemima alighted he quite jumped.  come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. give me the herbs for the omelette. be sharp!  he was rather abrupt. jemima puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.  she felt surprised, and uncomfortable.    while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it.  jemima became much alarmed.    a moment afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans.  and nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.  presently kep opened the door of the shed, and let out jemima puddle-duck.    unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.  he had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.    jemima puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.    she laid some more in june, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched.  jemima puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter. once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie, who lived at a farm called little-town. she was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!  one day little lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so! i've lost my pocket-handkin! three handkins and a pinny! have you seen them, tabby kitten?    the kitten went on washing her white paws; so lucie asked a speckled hen--  sally henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins?  but the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--  i go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!      and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig.  cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.  lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  and a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.    lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!    presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.  some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! and where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a very small person.  lucie ran on, and on.    the path ended under a big rock. the grass was short and green, and there were clothes--props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  but there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      lily-white and clean, oh!      with little frills between, oh!       smooth and hot--red rusty spot      never here be seen, oh!    lucie, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. a little frightened voice called out who's that?  lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. only the ceiling was so low that lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.    there was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at lucie.  her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where lucie had yellow curls--that little person had prickles!    who are you? said lucie. have you seen my pocket-handkins?  the little person made a bob-curtsey--oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is mrs. tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, i'm an excellent clear-starcher! and she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.    what's that thing? said lucie--that's not my pocket-handkin?  oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to cock robin!  and she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.    then she took something else off a clothes-horse--  that isn't my pinny? said lucie.  oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to jenny wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! it's very bad to wash! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    mrs. tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.    there's one of my pocket-handkins! cried lucie--and there's my pinny!  mrs. tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.  oh that is lovely! said lucie.    and what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?  oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to sally henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! she'll very soon go barefoot! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    why, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?  oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old mrs. rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! i've had to wash it separately, i can't get out the smell.  there's another one of mine, said lucie.    what are those funny little white things?  that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten; i only have to iron them; she washes them herself.  there's my last pocket-handkin! said lucie.    and what are you dipping into the basin of starch?  they're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to tom titmouse--most terrible particular! said mrs. tiggy-winkle. now i've finished my ironing; i'm going to air some clothes.    what are these dear soft fluffy things? said lucie.  oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at skelghyl.  will their jackets take off? asked lucie.  oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. and here's one marked for gatesgarth, and three that come from little-town. they're always marked at washing! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!    then mrs. tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for lucie. they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. mrs. tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that lucie didn't like to sit too near her.    when they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.  and then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.    then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs. tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!  all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny!    and she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs. tiggy-winkle.    so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except lucie's one little bundle.    lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say good-night, and to thank the washer-woman--but what a very odd thing! mrs. tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!  she was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?    and how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with prickles!  why! mrs. tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog.                                           (now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the     stile--but then how could she have found three clean     pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?      and besides--i have seen that door into the back of the hill     called cat bells--and besides i am very well acquainted with     dear mrs. tiggy-winkle!) once upon a time there were four little rabbits, and their names were--            flopsy,        mopsy,    cotton-tail, and peter.  they lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.  'now my dears,' said old mrs. rabbit one morning, 'you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into mr. mcgregor's garden: your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by mrs. mcgregor.'  'now run along, and don't get into mischief. i am going out.'  then old mrs. rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.  flopsy, mopsy, and cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries:  but peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to mr. mcgregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!  first he ate some lettuces and some french beans; and then he ate some radishes;  and then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.  but round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but mr. mcgregor!  mr. mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after peter, waving a rake and calling out, 'stop thief!'  peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.  he lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.  after losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that i think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. it was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.  peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.  mr. mcgregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of peter; but peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.  and rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.  mr. mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. he began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.  presently peter sneezed--'kertyschoo!' mr. mcgregor was after him in no time.  and tried to put his foot upon peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. the window was too small for mr. mcgregor, and he was tired of running after peter. he went back to his work.  peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. also he was very damp with sitting in that can.  after a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all round.  he found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.  an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. she only shook her head at him. peter began to cry.  then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. presently, he came to a pond where mr. mcgregor filled his water-cans. a white cat was staring at some gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little benjamin bunny.  he went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. peter scuttered underneath the bushes. but presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. the first thing he saw was mr. mcgregor hoeing onions. his back was turned towards peter, and beyond him was the gate!  peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.  mr. mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner, but peter did not care. he slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.  mr. mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.  peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.  he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. his mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight!  i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening.  his mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to peter!  'one table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'  but flopsy, mopsy, and cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper. this is a tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was nutkin.  he had a brother called twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.    in the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called old brown.    one autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green--nutkin and twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.    they made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to owl island to gather nuts.  each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.    they also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for old brown, and put them down upon his door-step.  then twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--  old mr. brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?    but nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. he bobbed up and down like a little red cherry, singing--      riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!      a little wee man, in a red red coat!      a staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;      if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a groat.  now this riddle is as old as the hills; mr. brown paid no attention whatever to nutkin.  he shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.    but next morning they all came back again to owl island; and twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of old brown's doorway, and said--  mr. brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?    but nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old mr. brown with a nettle and singing--      old mr. b! riddle-me-ree!      hitty pitty within the wall,      hitty pitty without the wall;      if you touch hitty pitty,      hitty pitty will bite you!  mr. brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.    he shut the door in nutkin's face. presently a little thread of blue smoke from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--      a house full, a hole full!      and you cannot gather a bowl-full!      the squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.  but nutkin gathered oak-apples--yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old mr. brown.    on the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for old brown.  they paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on owl island.    twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. he ran in front, singing--      the man in the wilderness said to me,     'how many strawberries grow in the sea?'      i answered him as i thought good--      'as many red herrings as grow in the wood.'  but old mr. brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.    on the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in plum-pudding for old brown. each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.  but nutkin sang as rudely as ever--       old mr. b! riddle-me-ree       flour of england, fruit of spain,       met together in a shower of rain;       put in a bag tied round with a string,     if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a ring!   which was ridiculous of nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to old brown.    the other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but nutkin gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins.    on the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. they had stolen it out of a bumble bees' nest on the tippitty top of the hill.  but nutkin skipped up and down, singing--      hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! hum-a-bum buzz!       as i went over tipple-tine       i met a flock of bonny swine;     some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!       they were the very bonniest swine       that e'er went over tipple-tine.    old mr. brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of nutkin.  but he ate up the honey!    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.  but nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.    on the sixth day, which was saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid egg in a little rush basket as a last parting present for old brown.  but nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--      humpty dumpty lies in the beck,      with a white counterpane round his neck,      forty doctors and forty wrights,      cannot put humpty dumpty to rights!    now old mr. brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. but still he did not speak.    nutkin became more and more impertinent--        old mr. b! old mr. b!     hickamore, hackamore, on the king's kitchen door;     all the king's horses, and all the king's men,     couldn't drive hickamore, hackamore,     off the king's kitchen door.  nutkin danced up and down like a sunbeam; but still old brown said nothing at all.    nutkin began again--      arthur o'bower has broken his band,      he comes roaring up the land!      the king of scots with all his power,      cannot turn arthur of the bower!  nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the wind, and he took a running jump right onto the head of old brown!...  then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud squeak!  the other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.    when they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree--there was old brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.                                       but nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!    this looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.    old brown carried nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic window.    and to this day, if you meet nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--  cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k! once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were mittens, tom kitten, and moppet.  they had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.  but one day their mother--mrs. tabitha twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.      first she scrubbed their faces (this one is moppet).  then she brushed their fur, (this one is mittens).      then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is tom kitten).  tom was very naughty, and he scratched.  mrs. tabitha dressed moppet and mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son thomas.      tom kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. his mother sewed them on again.  when the three kittens were ready, mrs. tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.  now keep your frocks clean, children! you must walk on your hind legs. keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from sally henny penny, and from the pig-stye and the puddle-ducks.      moppet and mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.  when they stood up there were several green smears!  let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall, said moppet.  they turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.      tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. he came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left.  he was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.  moppet and mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.      while they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step--pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!  they stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. they had very small eyes and looked surprised.      then the two duck-birds, rebeccah and jemima puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.  mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. moppet and tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of tom's clothes came off on the way down.  come! mr. drake puddle-duck, said moppet--come and help us to dress him! come and button up tom!      mr. drake puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles.  but he put them on himself! they fitted him even worse than tom kitten.  it's a very fine morning! said mr. drake puddle-duck.      and he and jemima and rebeccah puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!  then tabitha twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.      she pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.  my friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; i am affronted, said mrs. tabitha twitchit.  she sent them upstairs; and i am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true.      quite the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least.  somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.  and i think that some day i shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about tom kitten!    as for the puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.  the clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.      and mr. drake puddle-duck, and jemima and rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.\",\n          \"the following lines by mr. lear were written for a young lady of his acquaintance, who had quoted to him the words of a young lady not of his acquaintance,    how pleasant to know mr. lear!        how pleasant to know mr. lear!         who has written such volumes of stuff!       some think him ill-tempered and queer,         but a few think him pleasant enough.        his mind is concrete and fastidious,         his nose is remarkably big;       his visage is more or less hideous,         his beard it resembles a wig.        he has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers,         leastways if you reckon two thumbs;       long ago he was one of the singers,         but now he is one of the dumbs.        he sits in a beautiful parlor,         with hundreds of books on the wall;       he drinks a great deal of marsala,         but never gets tipsy at all.        he has many friends, lay men and clerical,         old foss is the name of his cat;       his body is perfectly spherical,         he weareth a runcible hat.        when he walks in waterproof white,         the children run after him so!       calling out, he's come out in his night-         gown, that crazy old englishman, oh!        he weeps by the side of the ocean,         he weeps on the top of the hill;       he purchases pancakes and lotion,         and chocolate shrimps from the mill.        he reads, but he cannot speak, spanish,         he cannot abide ginger beer:       ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,         how pleasant to know mr. lear!                                              introduction.  edward lear, the artist, author of journals of a landscape painter in various out-of-the-way countries, and of the delightful books of nonsense, which have amused successive generations of children, died on sunday, january 29, 1888, at san remo, italy, where he had lived for twenty years. few names could evoke a wider expression of passing regret at their appearance in the obituary column; for until his health began to fail he was known to an immense and almost a cosmopolitan circle of acquaintance, and popular wherever he was known. fewer still could call up in the minds of intimate friends a deeper and more enduring feeling of sorrow for personal loss, mingled with the pleasantest of memories; for it was impossible to know him thoroughly and not to love him. london, rome, the mediterranean countries generally, ceylon and india, are still all dotted with survivors among his generation who will mourn for him affectionately, although his latter years were spent in comparatively close retirement. he was a man of striking nobility of nature, fearless, independent, energetic, given to forming for himself strong opinions, often hastily, sometimes bitterly; not always strong or sound in judgment, but always seeking after truth in every matter, and following it as he understood it in scorn of consequence; utterly unselfish, devoted to his friends, generous even to extravagance towards any one who had ever been connected with his fortunes or his travels; playful, light-hearted, witty, and humorous, but not without those occasional fits of black depression and nervous irritability to which such temperaments are liable.  great and varied as the merits of his pictures are, lear hardly succeeded in achieving any great popularity as a landscape-painter. his work was frequently done on private commission, and he rarely sent in pictures for the academy or other exhibitions. his larger and more highly finished landscapes were unequal in technical perfection,--sometimes harsh or cold in color, or stiff in composition; sometimes full of imagination, at others literal and prosaic,--but always impressive reproductions of interesting or peculiar scenery. in later years he used in conversation to qualify himself as a topographical artist; and the definition was true, though not exhaustive. he had an intuitive and a perfectly trained eye for the character and beauty of distant mountain lines, the solemnity of rocky gorges, the majesty of a single mountain rising from a base of plain or sea; and he was equally exact in rendering the true forms of the middle distances and the specialties of foreground detail belonging to the various lands through which he had wandered as a sketcher. some of his pictures show a mastery which has rarely been equalled over the difficulties of painting an immense plain as seen from a height, reaching straight away from the eye of the spectator until it is lost in a dim horizon. sir roderick murchison used to say that he always understood the geological peculiarities of a country he had only studied in lear's sketches. the compliment was thoroughly justified; and it is not every landscape-painter to whom it could honestly be paid.  the history of lear's choice of a career was a curious one. he was the youngest of twenty-one children, and, through a family mischance, was thrown entirely on the limited resources of an elderly sister at a very early age. as a boy he had always dabbled in colors for his own amusement, and had been given to poring over the ordinary boys' books upon natural history. it occurred to him to try to turn his infant talents to account; and he painted upon cardboard a couple of birds in the style which the older among us remember as having been called oriental tinting, took them to a small shop, and sold them for fourpence. the kindness of friends, to whom he was ever grateful, gave him the opportunity of more serious and more remunerative study, and he became a patient and accurate zo\\u00f6logical draughtsman. many of the birds in the earlier volumes of gould's magnificent folios were drawn for him by lear. a few years back there were eagles alive in the zo\\u00f6logical gardens in regent's park to which lear could point as old familiar friends that he had drawn laboriously from claw to beak fifty years before. he united with this kind of work the more unpleasant occupation of drawing the curiosities of disease or deformity in hospitals. one day, as he was busily intent on the portrait of a bird in the zo\\u00f6logical gardens, an old gentleman came and looked over his shoulder, entered into conversation, and finally said to him, you must come and draw my birds at knowsley. lear did not know where knowsley was, or what it meant; but the old gentleman was the thirteenth earl of derby. the successive earls of derby have been among lear's kindest and most generous patrons. he went to knowsley, and the drawings in the knowsley menagerie (now a rare and highly-prized work among book collectors) are by lear's hand. at knowsley he became a permanent favorite; and it was there that he composed in prolific succession his charming and wonderful series of utterly nonsensical rhymes and drawings. lear had already begun seriously to study landscape. when english winters began to threaten his health, lord derby started a subscription which enabled him to go to rome as a student and artist, and no doubt gave him recommendations among anglo-roman society which laid the foundations of a numerous client\\u00e8le. it was in the roman summers that lear first began to exercise the taste for pictorial wandering which grew into a habit and a passion, to fill vivid and copious note-books as he went, and to illustrate them by spirited and accurate drawings; and his first volume of illustrated excursions in italy, published in 1846, is gratefully dedicated to his knowsley patron.  only those who have travelled with him could know what a delightful comrade he was to men whose tastes ran more or less parallel to his own. it was not everybody who could travel with him; for he was so irrepressibly anxious not to lose a moment of the time at his disposal for gathering into his garners the beauty and interest of the lands over which he journeyed, that he was careless of comfort and health. calabria, sicily, the desert of sinai, egypt and nubia, greece and albania, palestine, syria, athos, candia, montenegro, zag\\u00f3ri (who knows now where zag\\u00f3ri is, or was?), were as thoroughly explored and sketched by him as the more civilized localities of malta, corsica, and corfu. he read insatiably before starting all the recognized guide-books and histories of the country he intended to draw; and his published itineraries are marked by great strength and literary interest quite irrespectively of the illustrations. and he had his reward. it is not any ordinary journalist and sketcher who could have compelled from tennyson such a tribute as lines to e.l. on his travels in greece:--      illyrian woodlands, echoing falls       of water, sheets of summer glass,       the long divine pene\\u00efan pass,     the vast akrokeraunian walls,      tomohrit, athos, all things fair,       with such a pencil, such a pen,       you shadow forth to distant men,     i read and felt that i was there.  lear was a man to whom, as to tennyson's ulysses,      all experience is an arch wherethrough     gleams that untravelled world.  after settling at san remo, and when he was nearly sixty years old, he determined to visit india and ceylon. he started once and failed, being taken so ill at suez that he was obliged to return. the next year he succeeded, and brought away some thousands of drawings of the most striking views from all three presidencies and from the tropical island. his appetite for travel continued to grow with what it fed upon; and although he hated a long sea-voyage, he used seriously to contemplate as possible a visit to relations in new zealand. it may safely, however, be averred that no considerations would have tempted him to visit the arctic regions.      a hard-working life, checkered by the odd adventures which happen     to the odd and the adventurous and pass over the commonplace; a     career brightened by the high appreciation of unimpeachable     critics; lightened, till of late, by the pleasant society and good     wishes of innumerable friends; saddened by the growing pressure of     ill health and solitude; cheered by his constant trust in the love     and sympathy of those who knew him best, however far away,--such     was the life of edward lear.        --the london saturday review, feb. 4, 1888.  among the writers who have striven with varying success during the last thirty or forty years to awaken the merriment of the rising generation of the time being, mr. edward lear occupies the first place in seniority, if not in merit. the parent of modern nonsense-writers, he is distinguished from all his followers and imitators by the superior consistency with which he has adhered to his aim,--that of amusing his readers by fantastic absurdities, as void of vulgarity or cynicism as they are incapable of being made to harbor any symbolical meaning. he never deviates into sense; but those who appreciate him never feel the need of such deviation. he has a genius for coining absurd names and words, which, even when they are suggested by the exigencies of his metre, have a ludicrous appropriateness to the matter in hand. his verse is, with the exception of a certain number of cockney rhymes, wonderfully flowing and even melodious--or, as he would say, meloobious--while to all these qualifications for his task must finally be added the happy gift of pictorial expression, enabling him to double, nay, often to quadruple, the laughable effect of his text by an inexhaustible profusion of the quaintest designs. generally speaking, these designs are, as it were, an idealization of the efforts of a clever child; but now and then--as in the case of the nonsense-botany--mr. lear reminds us what a genuine and graceful artist he really is. the advantage to a humorist of being able to illustrate his own text has been shown in the case of thackeray and mr. w.s. gilbert, to mention two familiar examples; but in no other instance of such a combination have we discovered such geniality as is to be found in the nonsense-pictures of mr. lear. we have spoken above of the melodiousness of mr. lear's verses, a quality which renders them excellently suitable for musical setting, and which has not escaped the notice of the author himself. we have also heard effective arrangements, presumably by other composers, of the adventures of the table and the chair, and of the cruise of the owl and the pussy-cat,--the latter introduced into the drawing-room entertainment of one of the followers of john parry. indeed, in these days of adaptations, it is to be wondered at that no enterprising librettist has attempted to build a children's comic opera out of the materials supplied in the four books with which we are now concerned. the first of these, originally published in 1846, and brought out in an enlarged form in 1863, is exclusively devoted to nonsense-verses of one type. mr. lear is careful to disclaim the credit of having created this type, for he tells us in the preface to his third book that the lines beginning, 'there was an old man of tobago,' were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse leading itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures. dismissing the further question of the authorship of there was an old man of tobago, we propose to give a few specimens of mr. lear's protean powers as exhibited in the variation of this simple type. here, to begin with, is a favorite verse, which we are very glad to have an opportunity of giving, as it is often incorrectly quoted, cocks being substituted for owls in the third line:      there was an old man with a beard,     who said, 'it is just as i feared!     two owls and a hen, four larks and a wren,     have all built their nests in my beard!'  with the kindly fatalism which is the distinctive note of the foregoing stanza, the sentiment of our next extract is in vivid contrast:--       there was an old man in a tree,     who was terribly bored by a bee;     when they said, 'does it buzz?' he replied, 'yes, it does!     it's a regular brute of a bee.'  to the foregoing verse an historic interest attaches, if, that is, we are right in supposing it to have inspired mr. gilbert with his famous nonsense-rhyme in blank verse. we quote from memory:--      there was an old man of st. bees,     who was stung in the arm by a wasp.     when they asked, 'does it hurt?' he replied, 'no, it doesn't,     but i thought all the while 'twas a hornet!'  passing over the lines referring to the young person of crete to whom the epithet ombliferous is applied, we may be pardoned--on the ground of the geographical proximity of the two countries named--for quoting together two stanzas which in reality are separated by a good many pages:--      there was a young lady of norway,     who casually sat in a doorway;     when the doors queezed her flat, she exclaimed, 'what of that?'     this courageous young person of norway.      there was a young lady of sweden,     who went by the slow train to weedon;     when they cried, 'weedon station!' she made no observation,     but thought she should go back to sweden.  a noticeable feature about this first book, and one which we think is peculiar to it, is the harsh treatment which the eccentricities of the inhabitants of certain towns appear to have met with at the hands of their fellow-residents. no less than three people are smashed,--the old man of whitehaven who danced a quadrille with a raven; the old person of buda; and the old man with a gong who bumped at it all the day long, though in the last-named case we admit that there was considerable provocation. before quitting the first nonsense-book, we would point out that it contains one or two forms that are interesting; for instance, scroobious, which we take to be a portmanteau word, and spickle-speckled, a favorite form of reduplication with mr. lear, and of which the best specimen occurs in his last book, he tinkledy-binkledy-winkled the bell. the second book, published in 1871, shows mr. lear in the maturity of sweet desipience, and will perhaps remain the favorite volume of the four to grown-up readers. the nonsense-songs are all good, and the story of the four little children who went round the world is the most exquisite piece of imaginative absurdity that the present writer is acquainted with. but before coming to that, let us quote a few lines from the jumblies, who, as all the world knows, went to sea in a sieve:--        they sailed to the western sea, they did,       to a land all covered with trees.     and they bought an owl, and a useful cart,     and a pound of rice, and a cranberry tart,       and a hive of silvery bees.     and they bought a pig, and some green jack-daws,     and a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,     and forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,       and no end of stilton cheese.         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live.         their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.     and in twenty years they all came back,       in twenty years or more,     and every one said, 'how tall they've grown!     for they've been to the lakes, and the torrible zone,       and the hills of the chankly bore.'  from the pedestrian excursion of the table and the chair, we cannot resist making a brief quotation, though in this, as in every case, the inability to quote the drawings also is a sad drawback:--      so they both went slowly down,     and walked about the town,     with a cheerful bumpy sound,     as they toddled round and round.     and everybody cried,     as they hastened to their side,     'see, the table and the chair     have come out to take the air!'      but in going down an alley     to a castle in a valley,     they completely lost their way,     and wandered all the day,     till, to see them safely back,     they paid a ducky-quack,     and a beetle and a mouse,     who took them to their house.      then they whispered to each other,     'o delightful little brother,     what a lovely walk we've taken!     let us dine on beans and bacon!'     so the ducky and the leetle     browny-mousy, and the beetle     dined, and danced upon their heads,     till they toddled to their beds.  the story of the four little children who went round the world follows next, and the account of the manner in which they occupied themselves while on shipboard may be transcribed for the benefit of those unfortunate persons who have not perused the original: during the day-time violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt-water into a churn, while her three brothers churned it violently in the hope it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did. after journeying for a time, they saw some land at a distance, and when they came to it they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. besides that it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses with a great gulf-stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, five hundred and three feet high. in a later passage, we read how by-and-by the children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. each of these blue bottles contained a bluebottlefly, and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony, nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. our last quotation from this inimitable recital shall be from the description of their adventure on a great plain where they espied an object which on a nearer approach and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cake and oyster-shells. this turned out to be the co-operative cauliflower, who, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust ... suddenly arose, and in a somewhat plumdomphious manner hurried off towards the setting sun, his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers ... till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand. so remarkable a sight of course impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.  in his third book, mr. lear takes occasion in an entertaining preface to repudiate the charge of harboring any ulterior motive beyond that of nonsense pure and absolute in any of his verses or pictures, and tells a delightful anecdote illustrative of the persistently absurd report that the earl of derby was the author of the first book of nonsense. in this volume he reverts once more to the familiar form adopted in his original efforts, and with little falling off. it is to be remarked that the third division is styled twenty-six nonsense rhymes and pictures, although there is no more rhyme than reason in any of the set. our favorite illustrations are those of the scroobious snake who always wore a hat on his head, for fear he should bite anybody, and the visibly vicious vulture who wrote some verses to a veal-cutlet in a volume bound in vellum. in the fourth and last of mr. lear's books, we meet not only with familiar words, but personages and places,--old friends like the jumblies, the yonghy-bonghy-bo, the quangle wangle, the hills of the chankly bore, and the great gromboolian plain, as well as new creations, such as the dong with a luminous nose, whose story is a sort of nonsense version of the love of nausicaa for ulysses, only that the sexes are inverted. in these verses, graceful fancy is so subtly interwoven with nonsense as almost to beguile us into feeling a real interest in mr. lear's absurd creations. so again in the pelican chorus there are some charming lines:--      by day we fish, and at eve we stand     on long bare islands of yellow sand.     and when the sun sinks slowly down,     and the great rock-walls grow dark and brown,     when the purple river rolls fast and dim,     and the ivory ibis starlike skim,     wing to wing we dance around, etc.  the other nonsense-poems are all good, but we have no space for further quotation, and will take leave of our subject by propounding the following set of examination questions which a friend who is deeply versed in mr. lear's books has drawn up for us:--    1. what do you gather from a study of mr. lear's works to      have been the prevalent characteristics of the inhabitants of      gretna, prague, thermopylae, wick, and hong kong?    2. state briefly what historical events are connected with      ischia, chertsey, whitehaven, boulak, and jellibolee.    3. comment, with illustrations, upon mr. lear's use of the      following words: runcible, propitious, dolomphious, borascible,      fizzgiggious, himmeltanious, tumble-dum-down, spongetaneous.    4. enumerate accurately all the animals who lived on the      quangle wangle's hat, and explain how the quangle wangle      was enabled at once to enlighten his five travelling companions      as to the true nature of the co-operative cauliflower.    5. what were the names of the five daughters of the old      person of china, and what was the purpose for which the      old man of the dargle purchased six barrels of gargle?    6. collect notices of king xerxes in mr. lear's works, and      state your theory, if you have any, as to the character and      appearance of nupiter piffkin.    7. draw pictures of the plum-pudding flea, and the moppsikon      floppsikon bear, and state by whom waterproof tubs      were first used.    8.         there was an old man at a station                who made a promiscuous oration.       what bearing may we assume the foregoing couplet to have      upon mr. lear's political views?                                    --the london spectator.                                               a book of nonsense  by  edward lear.  with all the original pictures and verses           there was an old derry down derry, who loved to see little folks   merry;     so he made them a book, and with laughter they shook       at the fun of that derry down derry.                     original dedication.                         to the  great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces            of edward, 13th earl of derby,           this book of drawings and verses       (the greater part of which were originally          made and composed for their parents.)                 is dedicated by the author,                                           edward lear.         london, 1862.                                                         there was an old man with a nose,     who said, if you choose to suppose     that my nose is too long, you are certainly wrong!     that remarkable man with a nose.            there was a young person of smyrna,     whose grandmother threatened to burn her;

    when they said, are these caps? she answered, perhaps!     that oracular lady of prague.            there was a young lady of parma,     whose conduct grew calmer and calmer:     when they said, are you dumb? she merely said, hum!     that provoking young lady of parma.            there was an old person of sparta,     who had twenty-five sons and one darter;

    so he sate on a chair with his feet in the air,     that umbrageous old person of spain.            there was an old man who said, well!     will nobody answer this bell?     i have pulled day and night, till my hair has grown white,     but nobody answers this bell!            there was an old man with an owl,     who continued to bother and howl;

too long we have tarried:       but what shall we do for a ring?     they sailed away, for a year and a day,       to the land where the bong-tree grows;     and there in a wood a piggy-wig stood,       with a ring at the end of his nose,           his nose,           his nose,       with a ring at the end of his nose.                       iii.      dear pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling       your ring? said the piggy, i will.     so they took it away, and were married next day       by the turkey who lives on the hill.     they dined on mince and slices of quince,       which they ate with a runcible spoon;     and hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,       they danced by the light of the moon,           the moon,           the moon,     they danced by the light of the moon.       the duck and the kangaroo.                        i.      said the duck to the kangaroo,        good gracious! how you hop     over the fields, and the water too,         as if you never would stop!     my life is a bore in this nasty pond;     and i long to go out in the world beyond:         i wish i could hop like you,         said the duck to the kangaroo.                       ii.     please give me a ride on your back,         said the duck to the kangaroo:    i would sit quite still, and say nothing but 'quack'         the whole of the long day through;     and we 'd go the dee, and the jelly bo lee,     over the land, and over the sea:         please take me a ride! oh, do!         said the duck to the kangaroo.                                       iii.      said the kangaroo to the duck,        this requires some little reflection.     perhaps, on the whole, it might bring me luck;         and there seems but one objection;     which is, if you'll let me speak so bold,     your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,         and would probably give me the roo-         matiz, said the kangaroo.                                       iv.      said the duck, as i sate on the rocks,         i have thought over that completely;     and i bought four pairs of worsted socks,         which fit my web-feet neatly;     and, to keep out the cold, i've bought a cloak;     and every day a cigar i'll smoke;         all to follow my own dear true         love of a kangaroo.                       v.      said the kangaroo, i'm ready,         all in the moonlight pale;     but to balance me well, dear duck, sit steady,         and quite at the end of my tail.     so away they went with a hop and a bound;     and they hopped the whole world three times round.         and who so happy, oh! who,         as the duck and the kangaroo?                    the daddy long-legs and the fly.                        i.      once mr. daddy long-legs,         dressed in brown and gray,     walked about upon the sands         upon a summer's day:     and there among the pebbles,         when the wind was rather cold,     he met with mr. floppy fly,         all dressed in blue and gold;     and, as it was too soon to dine,     they drank some periwinkle-wine,     and played an hour or two, or more,     at battlecock and shuttledore.                       ii.      said mr. daddy long-legs         to mr. floppy fly,     why do you never come to court?         i wish you 'd tell me why.     all gold and shine, in dress so fine,         you'd quite delight the court.     why do you never go at all?         i really think you ought.     and, if you went, you'd see such sights!     such rugs and jugs and candle-lights!     and, more than all, the king and queen,--     one in red, and one in green.                       iii.      o mr. daddy long-legs!         said mr. floppy fly,     it's true i never go to court;         and i will tell you why.     if i had six long legs like yours,         at once i'd go to court;     but, oh! i can't, because my legs         are so extremely short.     and i'm afraid the king and queen     (one in red, and one in green)     would say aloud, 'you are not fit,     you fly, to come to court a bit!'                       iv.      oh, mr. daddy long-legs!         said mr. floppy fly,     i wish you 'd sing one little song,         one mumbian melody.     you used to sing so awful well         in former days gone by;     but now you never sing at all:         i wish you'd tell me why:     for, if you would, the silvery sound     would please the shrimps and cockles round,     and all the crabs would gladly come     to hear you sing, 'ah, hum di hum!'                       v.      said mr. daddy long-legs,        i can never sing again;     and, if you wish, i'll tell you why,         although it gives me pain.     for years i cannot hum a bit,         or sing the smallest song;     and this the dreadful reason is,--         my legs are grown too long!     my six long legs, all here and there,     oppress my bosom with despair;     and, if i stand or lie or sit,     i cannot sing one single bit!                       vi.      so mr. daddy long-legs         and mr. floppy fly     sat down in silence by the sea,         and gazed upon the sky.     they said, this is a dreadful thing!         the world has all gone wrong,     since one has legs too short by half,         the other much too long.     one never more can go to court,     because his legs have grown too short;     the other cannot sing a song,     because his legs have grown too long!                       vii.      then mr. daddy long-legs         and mr. floppy fly     rushed downward to the foamy sea         with one sponge-taneous cry:     and there they found a little boat,         whose sails were pink and gray;     and off they sailed among the waves,         far and far away:     they sailed across the silent main,     and reached the great gromboolian plain;     and there they play forevermore     at battlecock and shuttledore.       the jumblies.                        i.      they went to sea in a sieve, they did;         in a sieve they went to sea:     in spite of all their friends could say,     on a winter's morn, on a stormy day,         in a sieve they went to sea.     and when the sieve turned round and round,     and every one cried, you'll all be drowned!     they called aloud, our sieve ain't big;     but we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:         in a sieve we'll go to sea!              far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:              their heads are green, and their hands are blue         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        ii.      they sailed away in a sieve, they did,         in a sieve they sailed so fast,     with only a beautiful pea-green veil     tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,         to a small tobacco-pipe mast.     and every one said who saw them go,    oh! won't they be soon upset, you know?     for the sky is dark, and the voyage is long;     and, happen what may, it's extremely wrong         in a sieve to sail so fast.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        iii.      the water it soon came in, it did;         the water it soon came in:     so, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet         in a pinky paper all folded neat;     and they fastened it down with a pin.     and they passed the night in a crockery-jar;     and each of them said, how wise we are!     though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,     yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,         while round in our sieve we spin.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        iv.      and all night long they sailed away;         and when the sun went down,     they whistled and warbled a moony song         to the echoing sound of a coppery gong,     in the shade of the mountains brown.    o timballoo! how happy we are     when we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!     and all night long, in the moonlight pale,     we sail away with a pea-green sail         in the shade of the mountains brown.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        v.      they sailed to the western sea, they did,--         to a land all covered with trees:     and they bought an owl, and a useful cart,         and a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,     and a hive of silvery bees;     and they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,     and a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,     and forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,         and no end of stilton cheese.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        vi.      and in twenty years they all came back,--         in twenty years or more;     and every one said, how tall they've grown!         for they've been to the lakes, and the torrible zone,     and the hills of the chankly bore.     and they drank their health, and gave them a feast     of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;     and every one said, if we only live,     we, too, will go to sea in a sieve,         to the hills of the chankly bore.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.     the nutcrackers and the sugar-tongs.                         i.      the nutcrackers sate by a plate on the table;         the sugar-tongs sate by a plate at his side;     and the nutcrackers said, don't you wish we were able         along the blue hills and green meadows to ride?     must we drag on this stupid existence forever,         so idle and weary, so full of remorse,     while every one else takes his pleasure, and never         seems happy unless he is riding a horse?                        ii.      don't you think we could ride without being instructed,         without any saddle or bridle or spur?     our legs are so long, and so aptly constructed,         i'm sure that an accident could not occur.     let us all of a sudden hop down from the table,         and hustle downstairs, and each jump on a horse!     shall we try? shall we go? do you think we are able?         the sugar-tongs answered distinctly, of course!                        iii.      so down the long staircase they hopped in a minute;         the sugar-tongs snapped, and the crackers said crack!     the stable was open; the horses were in it:         each took out a pony, and jumped on his back.     the cat in a fright scrambled out of the doorway;         the mice tumbled out of a bundle of hay;     the brown and white rats, and the black ones from norway,         screamed out, they are taking the horses away!                        iv.      the whole of the household was filled with amazement:         the cups and the saucers danced madly about;     the plates and the dishes looked out of the casement;         the salt-cellar stood on his head with a shout;     the spoons, with a clatter, looked out of the lattice;         the mustard-pot climbed up the gooseberry-pies;     the soup-ladle peeped through a heap of veal-patties,         and squeaked with a ladle-like scream of surprise.                        v.      the frying-pan said, it's an awful delusion!         the tea-kettle hissed, and grew black in the face;     and they all rushed downstairs in the wildest confusion         to see the great nutcracker-sugar-tong race.     and out of the stable, with screamings and laughter         (their ponies were cream-colored, speckled with brown),     the nutcrackers first, and the sugar-tongs after;         rode all round the yard, and then all round the town.                        vi.      they rode through the street, and they rode by the station;         they galloped away to the beautiful shore;     in silence they rode, and made no observation,         save this: we will never go back any more!     and still you might hear, till they rode out of hearing,         the sugar-tongs snap, and the crackers say crack!     till, far in the distance their forms disappearing,         they faded away; and they never came back!     calico pie.                         i.        calico pie,       the little birds fly     down to the calico-tree:       their wings were blue,       and they sang tilly-loo!       till away they flew;         and they never came back to me!           they never came back,           they never came back,         they never came back to me!                        ii.        calico jam,       the little fish swam     over the syllabub sea.       he took off his hat       to the sole and the sprat,       and the willeby-wat:         but he never came back to me;           he never came back,           he never came back,         he never came back to me.                                         iii.        calico ban,       the little mice ran     to be ready in time for tea;       flippity flup,       they drank it all up,       and danced in the cup:         but they never came back to me;           they never came back,           they never came back,         they never came back to me.                                         iv.        calico drum,       the grasshoppers come,     the butterfly, beetle, and bee,       over the ground,       around and round,       with a hop and a bound;         but they never came back,           they never came back,           they never came back.         they never came back to me.                      mr. and mrs. spikky sparrow.                         i.      on a little piece of wood     mr. spikky sparrow stood:     mrs. sparrow sate close by,     a-making of an insect-pie     for her little children five,     in the nest and all alive;     singing with a cheerful smile,     to amuse them all the while,        twikky wikky wikky wee,         wikky bikky twikky tee,             spikky bikky bee!                        ii.      mrs. spikky sparrow said,     spikky, darling! in my head     many thoughts of trouble come,     like to flies upon a plum.     all last night, among the trees,     i heard you cough, i heard you sneeze;     and thought i, 'it's come to that     because he does not wear a hat!'         chippy wippy sikky tee,         bikky wikky tikky mee,             spikky chippy wee!                        iii.      not that you are growing old;     but the nights are growing cold.     no one stays out all night long     without a hat: i'm sure it's wrong!     mr. spikky said, how kind,     dear, you are, to speak your mind!     all your life i wish you luck!     you are, you are, a lovely duck!         witchy witchy witchy wee,         twitchy witchy witchy bee,             tikky tikky tee!                        iv.      i was also sad, and thinking,     when one day i saw you winking,     and i heard you sniffle-snuffle,     and i saw your feathers ruffle:     to myself i sadly said,     'she's neuralgia in her head!     that dear head has nothing on it!     ought she not to wear a bonnet?'         witchy kitchy kitchy wee,         spikky wikky mikky bee,             chippy wippy chee!                        v.      let us both fly up to town:     there i'll buy you such a gown!     which, completely in the fashion,     you shall tie a sky-blue sash on;     and a pair of slippers neat     to fit your darling little feet,     so that you will look and feel     quite galloobious and genteel.         jikky wikky bikky see,         chicky bikky wikky bee,             twicky witchy wee!                        vi.      so they both to london went,     alighting on the monument;     whence they flew down swiftly--pop!     into moses' wholesale shop:     there they bought a hat and bonnet,     and a gown with spots upon it,     a satin sash of cloxam blue,     and a pair of slippers too.         zikky wikky mikky bee,         witchy witchy mitchy kee,             sikky tikky wee!                        vii.      then, when so completely dressed,     back they flew, and reached their nest.     their children cried, o ma and pa!     how truly beautiful you are!     said they, we trust that cold or pain     we shall never feel again;     while, perched on tree or house or steeple,     we now shall look like other people.         witchy witchy witchy wee,         twikky mikky bikky bee,             zikky sikky tee!                      the broom, the shovel, the poker, and the tongs.                         i.      the broom and the shovel, the poker and tongs,       they all took a drive in the park;     and they each sang a song, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!       before they went back in the dark.     mr. poker he sate quite upright in the coach;       mr. tongs made a clatter and clash;     miss shovel was dressed all in black (with a brooch);       mrs. broom was in blue (with a sash).         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         and they all sang a song.                        ii.     o shovely so lovely! the poker he sang,      you have perfectly conquered my heart.     ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong! if you're pleased with my song,       i will feed you with cold apple-tart.     when you scrape up the coals with a delicate sound,       you enrapture my life with delight,     your nose is so shiny, your head is so round,       and your shape is so slender and bright!         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         ain't you pleased with my song?                        iii.     alas! mrs. broom, sighed the tongs in his song,      oh! is it because i'm so thin,     and my legs are so long,--ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!--       that you don't care about me a pin?     ah! fairest of creatures, when sweeping the room,       ah! why don't you heed my complaint?     must you needs be so cruel, you beautiful broom,       because you are covered with paint?         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         you are certainly wrong.                        iv.      mrs. broom and miss shovel together they sang,      what nonsense you're singing to-day!     said the shovel, i'll certainly hit you a bang!       said the broom, and i'll sweep you away!     so the coachman drove homeward as fast as he could,       perceiving their anger with pain;     but they put on the kettle, and little by little       they all became happy again.         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         there's an end of my song.     the table and the chair.                         i.      said the table to the chair,     you can hardly be aware     how i suffer from the heat     and from chilblains on my feet.     if we took a little walk,     we might have a little talk;     pray let us take the air,     said the table to the chair.                        ii.      said the chair unto the table,     now, you know we are not able:     how foolishly you talk,     when you know we cannot walk!     said the table with a sigh,     it can do no harm to try.     i've as many legs as you:     why can't we walk on two?                        iii.      so they both went slowly down,     and walked about the town     with a cheerful bumpy sound     as they toddled round and round;     and everybody cried,     as they hastened to their side,     see! the table and the chair     have come out to take the air!                        iv.      but in going down an alley,     to a castle in a valley,     they completely lost their way,     and wandered all the day;     till, to see them safely back,     they paid a ducky-quack,     and a beetle, and a mouse,     who took them to their house.                                        v.      then they whispered to each other,     o delightful little brother,     what a lovely walk we've taken!     let us dine on beans and bacon.     so the ducky and the leetle     browny-mousy and the beetle     dined, and danced upon their heads     till they toddled to their beds.                                                              nonsense stories.   the story of the four little children who went round the world.  once upon a time, a long while ago, there were four little people whose names were    violet, slingsby, guy, and lionel; and they all thought they should like to see the world. so they bought a large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, and then they were to come back on the other side by land. the boat was painted blue with green spots, and the sail was yellow with red stripes: and, when they set off, they only took a small cat to steer and look after the boat, besides an elderly quangle-wangle, who had to cook the dinner and make the tea; for which purposes they took a large kettle.    for the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and found plenty to eat, as there were lots of fish; and they had only to take them out of the sea with a long spoon, when the quangle-wangle instantly cooked them; and the pussy-cat was fed with the bones, with which she expressed herself pleased, on the whole: so that all the party were very happy.  during the daytime, violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt water into a churn; while her three brothers churned it violently, in the hope that it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did; and in the evening they all retired into the tea-kettle, where they all managed to sleep very comfortably, while pussy and the quangle-wangle managed the boat.    after a time, they saw some land at a distance; and, when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses, with a great gulf-stream running about all over it; so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.  when they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their great surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and chocolate-drops, and nothing else. so they all climbed up the single high tree to discover, if possible, if there were any people; but having remained on the top of the tree for a week, and not seeing anybody, they naturally concluded that there were no inhabitants; and accordingly, when they came down, they loaded the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets and a million of chocolate-drops; and these afforded them sustenance for more than a month, during which time they pursued their voyage with the utmost delight and apathy.    after this they came to a shore where there were no less than sixty-five great red parrots with blue tails, sitting on a rail all of a row, and all fast asleep. and i am sorry to say that the pussy-cat and the quangle-wangle crept softly, and bit off the tail-feathers of all the sixty-five parrots; for which violet reproved them both severely.    notwithstanding which, she proceeded to insert all the feathers--two hundred and sixty in number--in her bonnet; thereby causing it to have a lovely and glittering appearance, highly prepossessing and efficacious.    the next thing that happened to them was in a narrow part of the sea, which was so entirely full of fishes that the boat could go on no farther: so they remained there about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly all the fishes, which were soles, and all ready-cooked, and covered with shrimp-sauce, so that there was no trouble whatever. and as the few fishes who remained uneaten complained of the cold, as well as of the difficulty they had in getting any sleep on account of the extreme noise made by the arctic bears and the tropical turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood in great numbers, violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for several of the fishes, and slingsby administered some opium-drops to them; through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.    then they came to a country which was wholly covered with immense orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of fruit. so they all landed, taking with them the tea-kettle, intending to gather some of the oranges, and place them in it. but, while they were busy about this, a most dreadfully high wind rose, and blew out most of the parrot-tail feathers from violet's bonnet. that, however, was nothing compared with the calamity of the oranges falling down on their heads by millions and millions, which thumped and bumped and bumped and thumped them all so seriously, that they were obliged to run as hard as they could for their lives; besides that the sound of the oranges rattling on the tea-kettle was of the most fearful and amazing nature.    nevertheless, they got safely to the boat, although considerably vexed and hurt; and the quangle-wangle's right foot was so knocked about, that he had to sit with his head in his slipper for at least a week.    this event made them all for a time rather melancholy: and perhaps they might never have become less so, had not lionel, with a most praiseworthy devotion and perseverance, continued to stand on one leg, and whistle to them in a loud and lively manner; which diverted the whole party so extremely that they gradually recovered their spirits, and agreed that whenever they should reach home, they would subscribe towards a testimonial to lionel, entirely made of gingerbread and raspberries, as an earnest token of their sincere and grateful infection.    after sailing on calmly for several more days, they came to another country, where they were much pleased and surprised to see a countless multitude of white mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle, slowly eating custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite demeanor.    and as the four travellers were rather hungry, being tired of eating nothing but soles and oranges for so long a period, they held a council as to the propriety of asking the mice for some of their pudding in a humble and affecting manner, by which they could hardly be otherwise than gratified. it was agreed, therefore, that guy should go and ask the mice, which he immediately did; and the result was, that they gave a walnut-shell only half full of custard diluted with water. now, this displeased guy, who said, out of such a lot of pudding as you have got, i must say, you might have spared a somewhat larger quantity. but no sooner had he finished speaking than the mice turned round at once, and sneezed at him in an appalling and vindictive manner (and it is impossible to imagine a more scroobious and unpleasant sound than that caused by the simultaneous sneezing of many millions of angry mice); so that guy rushed back to the boat, having first shied his cap into the middle of the custard-pudding, by which means he completely spoiled the mice's dinner.    by and by the four children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. each of these blue bottles contained a blue-bottle-fly; and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony: nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. violet and slingsby and guy and lionel were greatly struck with this singular and instructive settlement; and, having previously asked permission of the blue-bottle-flies (which was most courteously granted), the boat was drawn up to the shore, and they proceeded to make tea in front of the bottles: but as they had no tea-leaves, they merely placed some pebbles in the hot water; and the quangle-wangle played some tunes over it on an accordion, by which, of course, tea was made directly, and of the very best quality.  the four children then entered into conversation with the blue-bottle-flies, who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they each held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally occasioned a fizzy, extraneous utterance.  why, said violet, would you kindly inform us, do you reside in bottles; and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple, or, indeed, in yellow bottles?  to which questions a very aged blue-bottle-fly answered, we found the bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our great-great-great- great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at once. and, when the winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside down, and consequently rarely feel the cold at all; and you know very well that this could not be the case with bottles of any other color than blue.  of course it could not, said slingsby. but, if we may take the liberty of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?  mainly on oyster-patties, said the blue-bottle-fly; and, when these are scarce, on raspberry vinegar and russian leather boiled down to a jelly.  how delicious! said guy.  to which lionel added, huzz! and all the blue-bottle-flies said, buzz!  at this time, an elderly fly said it was the hour for the evening-song to be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the blue-bottle-flies began to buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner, the melodious and mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters, and resounding across the tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice upon the intervening and verdant mountains with a serene and sickly suavity only known to the truly virtuous. the moon was shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky, while her light irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of the blue-bottle-flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous circumstances.  in many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to that evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was already past midnight when--the sail of the boat having been set up by the quangle-wangle, the tea-kettle and churn placed in their respective positions, and the pussy-cat stationed at the helm--the children each took a last and affectionate farewell of the blue-bottle-flies, who walked down in a body to the water's edge to see the travellers embark.    as a token of parting respect and esteem, violet made a courtesy quite down to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining parrot-tail feathers into the back hair of the most pleasing of the blue-bottle-flies; while slingsby, guy, and lionel offered them three small boxes, containing, respectively, black pins, dried figs, and epsom salts; and thus they left that happy shore forever.  overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly jumped into the tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. but all along the shore, for many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of severely-suppressed sobs, and of a vague multitude of living creatures using their pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous snuffle, lingering sadly along the walloping waves as the boat sailed farther and farther away from the land of the happy blue-bottle-flies.  nothing particular occurred for some days after these events, except that, as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they perceived an unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large number of crabs and crawfish--perhaps six or seven hundred--sitting by the water-side, and endeavoring to disentangle a vast heap of pale pink worsted, which they moistened at intervals with a fluid composed of lavender-water and white-wine negus.  can we be of any service to you, o crusty crabbies? said the four children.  thank you kindly, said the crabs consecutively. we are trying to make some worsted mittens, but do not know how.  on which violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of mitten-making, said to the crabs, do your claws unscrew, or are they fixtures?  they are all made to unscrew, said the crabs; and forthwith they deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which violet uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest mittens with it you can imagine. these the crabs, having resumed and screwed on their claws, placed cheerfully upon their wrists, and walked away rapidly on their hind-legs, warbling songs with a silvery voice and in a minor key.  after this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to a vast and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing whatever could be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked onward, there appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single object, which on a nearer approach, and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig, sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cakes and oyster-shells. it does not quite look like a human being, said violet doubtfully; nor could they make out what it really was, till the quangle-wangle (who had previously been round the world) exclaimed softly in a loud voice, it is the co-operative cauliflower!    and so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the cauliflower; and that he had no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk,--an accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense of stockings and shoes.  presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and, in a somewhat plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the setting sun,--his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers, and a large number of waterwagtails proceeding in advance of him by three and three in a row,--till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand.    so remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.  shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below some high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly odious little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers, and with a pewter plate upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin at the boat, by which it was instantly upset.    but this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party knew how to swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming about till after the moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they sponge-taneously entered the boat. meanwhile the quangle-wangle threw back the pumpkin with immense force, so that it hit the rocks where the malicious little boy in rose-colored knickerbockers was sitting; when, being quite full of lucifer-matches, the pumpkin exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits; whereon the rocks instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became unpleasantly hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were turned quite green, and his nose was burnt off.  two or three days after this had happened, they came to another place, where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep pits full of mulberry-jam. this is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed apes who abound in these districts, and who store up the mulberry-jam for their food in winter, when they mix it with pellucid pale periwinkle-soup, and serve it out in wedgewood china-bowls, which grow freely all over that part of the country. only one of the yellow-nosed apes was on the spot, and he was fast asleep; yet the four travellers and the quangle-wangle and pussy were so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring, that they merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned to re-embark in their boat without delay.  what was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn and the tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous seeze pyder, an aquatic and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and, happily, only met with in those excessive longitudes! in a moment, the beautiful boat was bitten into fifty-five thousand million hundred billion bits; and it instantly became quite clear that violet, slingsby, guy, and lionel could no longer preliminate their voyage by sea.  the four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing their wanderings by land: and, very fortunately, there happened to pass by at that moment an elderly rhinoceros, on which they seized; and, all four mounting on his back,--the quangle-wangle sitting on his horn, and holding on by his ears, and the pussy-cat swinging at the end of his tail,--they set off, having only four small beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes to last through their whole journey.    they were, however, able to catch numbers of the chickens and turkeys and other birds who incessantly alighted on the head of the rhinoceros for the purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew there; and these creatures they cooked in the most translucent and satisfactory manner by means of a fire lighted on the end of the rhinoceros's back. a crowd of kangaroos and gigantic cranes accompanied them, from feelings of curiosity and complacency; so that they were never at a loss for company, and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse and triumphant procession.  thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at home, where they were received by their admiring relatives with joy tempered with contempt, and where they finally resolved to carry out the rest of their travelling-plans at some more favorable opportunity.  as for the rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they had him killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside the door of their father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper.       the history of the seven families of the lake pipple-popple.   chapter i.  introductory.  in former days,--that is to say, once upon a time,--there lived in the land of gramble-blamble seven families. they lived by the side of the great lake pipple-popple (one of the seven families, indeed, lived in the lake), and on the outskirts of the city of tosh, which, excepting when it was quite dark, they could see plainly. the names of all these places you have probably heard of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to find out all about them.  now, the seven families who lived on the borders of the great lake pipple-popple were as follows in the next chapter.   chapter ii.  the seven families.  there was a family of two old parrots and seven young parrots.    there was a family of two old storks and seven young storks.    there was a family of two old geese and seven young geese.    there was a family of two old owls and seven young owls.    there was a family of two old guinea pigs and seven young guinea pigs.    there was a family of two old cats and seven young cats.    and there was a family of two old fishes and seven young fishes.     chapter iii.  the habits of the seven families.  the parrots lived upon the soffsky-poffsky trees, which were beautiful to behold, and covered with blue leaves; and they fed upon fruit, artichokes, and striped beetles.  the storks walked in and out of the lake pipple-popple, and ate frogs for breakfast, and buttered toast for tea; but on account of the extreme length of their legs they could not sit down, and so they walked about continually.  the geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies, which they ate for dinner.  the owls anxiously looked after mice, which they caught, and made into sago-puddings.  the guinea pigs toddled about the gardens, and ate lettuces and cheshire cheese.  the cats sate still in the sunshine, and fed upon sponge biscuits.  the fishes lived in the lake, and fed chiefly on boiled periwinkles.  and all these seven families lived together in the utmost fun and felicity.   chapter iv.  the children of the seven families are sent away.  one day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the seven families agreed that they would send their children out to see the world.  so they called them all together, and gave them each eight shillings and some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small green morocco pocket-book to set down their expenses in.  they then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all the parents sent off their children with a parting injunction.  if, said the old parrots, you find a cherry, do not fight about who should have it.  and, said the old storks, if you find a frog, divide it carefully into seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it.  and the old geese said to the seven young geese, whatever you do, be sure you do not touch a plum-pudding flea.  and the old owls said, if you find a mouse, tear him up into seven slices, and eat him cheerfully, but without quarrelling.  and the old guinea pigs said, have a care that you eat your lettuces, should you find any, not greedily, but calmly.  and the old cats said, be particularly careful not to meddle with a clangle-wangle if you should see one.  and the old fishes said, above all things, avoid eating a blue boss-woss; for they do not agree with fishes, and give them a pain in their toes.  so all the children of each family thanked their parents; and, making in all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide world.    chapter v.  the history of the seven young parrots.  the seven young parrots had not gone far, when they saw a tree with a single cherry on it, which the oldest parrot picked instantly; but the other six, being extremely hungry, tried to get it also. on which all the seven began to fight; and they scuffled,      and huffled,        and ruffled,          and shuffled,            and puffled,              and muffled,                and buffled,                  and duffled,                    and fluffled,                      and guffled,                        and bruffled,                          and screamed, and shrieked, and squealed, and squeaked, and clawed, and snapped, and bit, and bumped, and thumped, and dumped, and flumped each other, till they were all torn into little bits; and at last there was nothing left to record this painful incident except the cherry and seven small green feathers.  and that was the vicious and voluble end of the seven young parrots.     chapter vi.  the history of the seven young storks.  when the seven young storks set out, they walked or flew for fourteen weeks in a straight line, and for six weeks more in a crooked one; and after that they ran as hard as they could for one hundred and eight miles; and after that they stood still, and made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery noise with their bills.  about the same time they perceived a large frog, spotted with green, and with a sky-blue stripe under each ear.  so, being hungry, they immediately flew at him, and were going to divide him into seven pieces, when they began to quarrel as to which of his legs should be taken off first. one said this, and another said that; and while they were all quarrelling, the frog hopped away. and when they saw that he was gone, they began to   chatter-clatter,       blatter-platter,           patter-blatter,               matter-clatter,                   flatter-quatter, more violently than ever; and after they had fought for a week, they pecked each other all to little pieces, so that at last nothing was left of any of them except their bills.  and that was the end of the seven young storks.     chapter vii.  the history of the seven young geese.  when the seven young geese began to travel, they went over a large plain, on which there was but one tree, and that was, a very bad one.  so four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about them; while the other three waddled up and down, and repeated poetry, and their last six lessons in arithmetic, geography, and cookery.  presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most interesting and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body exactly resembling a boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and a beak, and three feathers growing out of his head, and only one leg.  so, after a time, all the seven young geese said to each other, beyond all doubt this beast must be a plum-pudding flea!  on which they incautiously began to sing aloud,         plum-pudding flea,         plum-pudding flea,         wherever you be,         oh! come to our tree,     and listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!  and no sooner had they sung this verse than the plum-pudding flea began to hop and skip on his one leg with the most dreadful velocity, and came straight to the tree, where he stopped, and looked about him in a vacant and voluminous manner.  on which the seven young geese were greatly alarmed, and all of a tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and just touched him with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he done this than the plum-pudding flea skipped and hopped about more and more, and higher and higher; after which he opened his mouth, and, to the great surprise and indignation of the seven geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and terribly, that they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees every one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.  so that was the end of the seven young geese.     chapter viii.  the history of the seven young owls.  when the seven young owls set out, they sate every now and then on the branches of old trees, and never went far at one time.  and one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard a mouse; but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not see him.  so they called out, is that a mouse?  on which a mouse answered, squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!  and immediately all the young owls threw themselves off the tree, meaning to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive that there was a large well below them, into which they all fell superficially, and were every one of them drowned in less than half a minute.  so that was the end of the seven young owls.     chapter ix.  the history of the seven young guinea pigs.  the seven young guinea pigs went into a garden full of goose-berry-bushes and tiggory-trees, under one of which they fell asleep. when they awoke, they saw a large lettuce, which had grown out of the ground while they had been sleeping, and which had an immense number of green leaves. at which they all exclaimed,--     lettuce! o lettuce     let us, o let us,     o lettuce-leaves,     o let us leave this tree, and eat     lettuce, o let us, lettuce-leaves!  and instantly the seven young guinea pigs rushed with such extreme force against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly against its stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient transitional inflammation of their noses, which grew worse and worse and worse and worse, till it incidentally killed them all seven.  and that was the end of the seven young guinea pigs.     chapter x.  the history of the seven young cats.  the seven young cats set off on their travels with great delight and rapacity. but, on coming to the top of a high hill, they perceived at a long distance off a clangle-wangle (or, as it is more properly written, clangel-wangel); and, in spite of the warning they had had, they ran straight up to it.  (now, the clangle-wangle is a most dangerous and delusive beast, and by no means commonly to be met with. they live in the water as well as on land, using their long tail as a sail when in the former element. their speed is extreme; but their habits of life are domestic and superfluous, and their general demeanor pensive and pellucid. on summer evenings, they may sometimes be observed near the lake pipple-popple, standing on their heads, and humming their national melodies. they subsist entirely on vegetables, excepting when they eat veal or mutton or pork or beef or fish or saltpetre.)  the moment the clangle-wangle saw the seven young cats approach, he ran away; and as he ran straight on for four months, and the cats, though they continued to run, could never overtake him, they all gradually died of fatigue and exhaustion, and never afterwards recovered.  and this was the end of the seven young cats.     chapter xi.  the history of the seven young fishes.  the seven young fishes swam across the lake pipple-popple, and into the river, and into the ocean; where, most unhappily for them, they saw, on the fifteenth day of their travels, a bright-blue boss-woss, and instantly swam after him. but the blue boss-woss plunged into a     perpendicular,         spicular,             orbicular,                 quadrangular,                      circular depth of soft mud; where, in fact, his house was.  and the seven young fishes, swimming with great and uncomfortable velocity, plunged also into the mud quite against their will, and, not being accustomed to it, were all suffocated in a very short period.  and that was the end of the seven young fishes.     chapter xii.  of what occurred subsequently.  after it was known that the              seven young parrots,     and the seven young storks,     and the seven young geese,     and the seven young owls,     and the seven young guinea pigs,     and the seven young cats,     and the seven young fishes,  were all dead, then the frog, and the plum-pudding flea, and the mouse, and the clangle-wangle, and the blue boss-woss, all met together to rejoice over their good fortune. and they collected the seven feathers of the seven young parrots, and the seven bills of the seven young storks, and the lettuce, and the cherry; and having placed the latter on the lettuce, and the other objects in a circular arrangement at their base, they danced a hornpipe round all these memorials until they were quite tired; after which they gave a tea-party, and a garden-party, and a ball, and a concert, and then returned to their respective homes full of joy and respect, sympathy, satisfaction, and disgust.     chapter xiii.  of what became of the parents of the forty-nine children.  but when the two old parrots,      and the two old storks,      and the two old geese,      and the two old owls,      and the two old guinea pigs,      and the two old cats,      and the two old fishes,  became aware, by reading in the newspapers, of the calamitous extinction of the whole of their families, they refused all further sustenance; and, sending out to various shops, they purchased great quantities of cayenne pepper and brandy and vinegar and blue sealing-wax, besides seven immense glass bottles with air-tight stoppers. and, having done this, they ate a light supper of brown-bread and jerusalem artichokes, and took an affecting and formal leave of the whole of their acquaintance, which was very numerous and distinguished and select and responsible and ridiculous.   chapter xiv.  conclusion.  and after this they filled the bottles with the ingredients for pickling, and each couple jumped into a separate bottle; by which effort, of course, they all died immediately, and became thoroughly pickled in a few minutes; having previously made their wills (by the assistance of the most eminent lawyers of the district), in which they left strict orders that the stoppers of the seven bottles should be carefully sealed up with the blue sealing-wax they had purchased; and that they themselves, in the bottles, should be presented to the principal museum of the city of tosh, to be labelled with parchment or any other anti-congenial succedaneum, and to be placed on a marble table with silver-gilt legs, for the daily inspection and contemplation, and for the perpetual benefit, of the pusillanimous public.  and if you ever happen to go to gramble-blamble, and visit that museum in the city of tosh, look for them on the ninety-eighth table in the four hundred and twenty-seventh room of the right-hand corridor of the left wing of the central quadrangle of that magnificent building; for, if you do not, you certainly will not see them.                                                                 nonsense cookery.  extract from the nonsense gazette, for august, 1870.  our readers will be interested in the following communications from our valued and learned contributor, prof. bosh, whose labors in the fields of culinary and botanical science are so well known to all the world. the first three articles richly merit to be added to the domestic cookery of every family: those which follow claim the attention of all botanists; and we are happy to be able, through dr. bosh's kindness, to present our readers with illustrations of his discoveries. all the new flowers are found in the valley of verrikwier, near the lake of oddgrow, and on the summit of the hill orfeltugg.    three receipts for domestic cookery.   to make an amblongus pie.  take 4 pounds (say 4-1/2 pounds) of fresh amblongusses, and put them in a small pipkin.  cover them with water, and boil them for 8 hours incessantly; after which add 2 pints of new milk, and proceed to boil for 4 hours more.  when you have ascertained that the amblongusses are quite soft, take them out, and place them in a wide pan, taking care to shake them well previously.  grate some nutmeg over the surface, and cover them carefully with powdered gingerbread, curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity of cayenne pepper.  remove the pan into the next room, and place it on the floor. bring it back again, and let it simmer for three-quarters of an hour. shake the pan violently till all the amblongusses have become of a pale purple color.  then, having prepared the paste, insert the whole carefully; adding at the same time a small pigeon, 2 slices of beef, 4 cauliflowers, and any number of oysters.  watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of salt from time to time.  serve up in a clean dish, and throw the whole out of window as fast as possible.   to make crumbobblious cutlets.  procure some strips of beef, and, having cut them into the smallest possible slices, proceed to cut them still smaller,--eight, or perhaps nine times.  when the whole is thus minced, brush it up hastily with a new clothes-brush, and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon or a soup-ladle.  place the whole in a saucepan, and remove it to a sunny place,--say the roof of the house, if free from sparrows or other birds,--and leave it there for about a week.  at the end of that time add a little lavender, some oil of almonds, and a few herring-bones; and then cover the whole with 4 gallons of clarified crumbobblious sauce, when it will be ready for use.  cut it into the shape of ordinary cutlets, and serve up in a clean table-cloth or dinner-napkin.   to make gosky patties.  take a pig three or four years of age, and tie him by the off hind-leg to a post. place 5 pounds of currants, 3 of sugar, 2 pecks of peas, 18 roast chestnuts, a candle, and 6 bushels of turnips, within his reach: if he eats these, constantly provide him with more.  then procure some cream, some slices of cheshire cheese, 4 quires of foolscap paper, and a packet of black pins. work the whole into a paste, and spread it out to dry on a sheet of clean brown waterproof linen.  when the paste is perfectly dry, but not before, proceed to beat the pig violently with the handle of a large broom. if he squeals, beat him again.  visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days, and ascertain if, at the end of that period, the whole is about to turn into gosky patties.  if it does not then, it never will; and in that case the pig may be let loose, and the whole process may be considered as finished.                                              nonsense botany.

 (the ladies looked puzzled, as indeed was i, the author.)  do you not know who is the writer of it? asked the gentleman.  the name is 'edward lear,' said one of the ladies.  ah! said the first speaker, so it is printed; but that is only a whim of the real author, the earl of derby. 'edward' is his christian name, and, as you may see, lear is only earl transposed.  but, said the lady, doubtingly, here is a dedication to the great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces of edward, thirteenth earl of derby, by the author, edward lear.  that, replied the other, is simply a piece of mystification; i am in a position to know that the whole book was composed and illustrated by lord derby himself. in fact, there is no such a person at all as edward lear.  yet, said the other lady, some friends of mine tell me they know mr. lear.  quite a mistake! completely a mistake! said the old gentleman, becoming rather angry at the contradiction; i am well aware of what i am saying: i can inform you, no such a person as 'edward lear' exists!  hitherto i had kept silence; but as my hat was, as well as my handkerchief and stick, largely marked inside with my name, and as i happened to have in my pocket several letters addressed to me, the temptation was too great to resist; so, flashing all these articles at once on my would-be extinguisher's attention, i speedily reduced him to silence.  the second volume of nonsense, commencing with the verses, the owl and the pussy-cat, was written at different times, and for different sets of children: the whole being collected in the course of last year, were then illustrated, and published in a single volume, by mr. r.j. bush, of 32 charing cross.  the contents of the third or present volume were made also at different intervals in the last two years.  long years ago, in days when much of my time was passed in a country house, where children and mirth abounded, the lines beginning, there was an old man of tobago, were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse lending itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures; and thenceforth the greater part of the original drawings and verses for the first book of nonsense were struck off with a pen, no assistance ever having been given me in any way but that of uproarious delight and welcome at the appearance of every new absurdity.  most of these drawings and rhymes were transferred to lithographic stones in the year 1846, and were then first published by mr. thomas mclean, of the haymarket. but that edition having been soon exhausted, and the call for the book of nonsense continuing, i added a considerable number of subjects to those previously-published, and having caused the whole to be carefully reproduced in woodcuts by messrs. dalzell, i disposed of the copyright to messrs. routledge and warne, by whom the volume was published in 1843.                                                               edward lear.  villa emily, san remo, august, 1871.                                              nonsense botany.

they only said, stuff!     you amazing old man on the humber!            there was an old man in a barge,     whose nose was exceedingly large;     but in fishing by night, it supported a light,     which helped that old man in a barge.            there was an old man of dunrose;     a parrot seized hold of his nose.     when he grew melancholy, they said, his name's polly,     which soothed that old man of dunrose.            there was an old man of toulouse     who purchased a new pair of shoes;     when they asked, are they pleasant? he said, not at present!     that turbid old man of toulouse.            there was an old person of bree,     who frequented the depths of the sea;     she nurs'd the small fishes, and washed all the dishes,     and swam back again into bree.            there was an old person of bromley,     whose ways were not cheerful or comely;     he sate in the dust, eating spiders and crust,     that unpleasing old person of bromley.            there was an old person of shields,     who frequented the vallies and fields;     all the mice and the cats, and the snakes and the rats,     followed after that person of shields.            there was an old man of dunluce,     who went out to sea on a goose:     when he'd gone out a mile, he observ'd with a smile,     it is time to return to dunluce.            there was an old man of dee-side     whose hat was exceedingly wide,     but he said, do not fail, if it happen to hail,     to come under my hat at dee-side!

the dong!       the wandering dong through the forest goes!         the dong! the dong!       the dong with a luminous nose!          long years ago       the dong was happy and gay,     till he fell in love with a jumbly girl       who came to those shores one day.     for the jumblies came in a sieve, they did,--     landing at eve near the zemmery fidd         where the oblong oysters grow,       and the rocks are smooth and gray.     and all the woods and the valleys rang     with the chorus they daily and nightly sang,--         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live;           their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.      happily, happily passed those days!       while the cheerful jumblies staid;         they danced in circlets all night long,         to the plaintive pipe of the lively dong,       in moonlight, shine, or shade.     for day and night he was always there     by the side of the jumbly girl so fair,     with her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;     till the morning came of that hateful day     when the jumblies sailed in their sieve away,     and the dong was left on the cruel shore     gazing, gazing for evermore,--     ever keeping his weary eyes on     that pea-green sail on the far horizon,--     singing the jumbly chorus still     as he sate all day on the grassy hill,--         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live;           their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.      but when the sun was low in the west,         the dong arose and said,--     what little sense i once possessed         has quite gone out of my head!     and since that day he wanders still     by lake and forest, marsh and hill,     singing, o somewhere, in valley or plain,     might i find my jumbly girl again!     for ever i'll seek by lake and shore     till i find my jumbly girl once more!          playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,         since then his jumbly girl he seeks;         and because by night he could not see,         he gathered the bark of the twangum tree           on the flowery plain that grows.           and he wove him a wondrous nose,--         a nose as strange as a nose could be!      of vast proportions and painted red,     and tied with cords to the back of his head.         in a hollow rounded space it ended         with a luminous lamp within suspended,             all fenced about             with a bandage stout             to prevent the wind from blowing it out;         and with holes all round to send the light         in gleaming rays on the dismal night      and now each night, and all night long,     over those plains still roams the dong;     and above the wail of the chimp and snipe     you may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,     while ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,     to meet with his jumbly girl again;     lonely and wild, all night he goes,--     the dong with a luminous nose!     and all who watch at the midnight hour,     from hall or terrace or lofty tower,     cry, as they trace the meteor bright,     moving along through the dreary night,--        this is the hour when forth he goes,         the dong with a luminous nose!         yonder, over the plain he goes,--             he goes!             he goes,--         the dong with a luminous nose!     the two old bachelors.    two old bachelors were living in one house; one caught a muffin, the other caught a mouse. said he who caught the muffin to him who caught the mouse,-- this happens just in time! for we've nothing in the house, save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey, and what to do for dinner--since we haven't any money? and what can we expect if we haven't any dinner, but to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?  said he who caught the mouse to him who caught the muffin,-- we might cook this little mouse, if we only had some stuffin'! if we had but sage and onion we could do extremely well; but how to get that stuffin' it is difficult to tell!  those two old bachelors ran quickly to the town and asked for sage and onion as they wandered up and down; they borrowed two large onions, but no sage was to be found in the shops, or in the market, or in all the gardens round.  but some one said, a hill there is, a little to the north, and to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth; and there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient sage,-- an earnest man, who reads all day a most perplexing page. climb up, and seize him by the toes,--all studious as he sits,-- and pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits! then mix him with your onion (cut up likewise into scraps),-- when your stuffin' will be ready, and very good--perhaps.  those two old bachelors without loss of time the nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb; and at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook, they saw that sage a-reading of a most enormous book.  you earnest sage! aloud they cried, your book you've read enough in! we wish to chop you into bits to mix you into stuffin'!  but that old sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book, at those two bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took; and over crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,-- at once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town; and when they reached their house, they found (besides their want                                                           of stuffin'), the mouse had fled--and, previously, had eaten up the muffin.  they left their home in silence by the once convivial door; and from that hour those bachelors were never heard of more.   [illustration: sheet music--the pelicans]      the pelican chorus.      king and queen of the pelicans we;      no other birds so grand we see!     none but we have feet like fins!     with lovely leathery throats and chins!         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still      we live on the nile. the nile we love.     by night we sleep on the cliffs above;     by day we fish, and at eve we stand     on long bare islands of yellow sand.     and when the sun sinks slowly down,     and the great rock walls grow dark and brown,      where the purple river rolls fast and dim     and the ivory ibis starlike skim,     wing to wing we dance around,     stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,     opening our mouths as pelicans ought;     and this is the song we nightly snort,--         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      last year came out our daughter dell,     and all the birds received her well.     to do her honor a feast we made     for every bird that can swim or wade,--     herons and gulls, and cormorants black,     cranes, and flamingoes with scarlet back,     plovers and storks, and geese in clouds,     swans and dilberry ducks in crowds:     thousands of birds in wondrous flight!     they ate and drank and danced all night,     and echoing back from the rocks you heard     multitude-echoes from bird and bird,--         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      yes, they came; and among the rest     the king of the cranes all grandly dressed.     such a lovely tail! its feathers float     between the ends of his blue dress-coat;     with pea-green trowsers all so neat,     and a delicate frill to hide his feet     (for though no one speaks of it, every one knows     he has got no webs between his toes).      as soon as he saw our daughter dell,     in violent love that crane king fell,--     on seeing her waddling form so fair,     with a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.     and before the end of the next long day     our dell had given her heart away;     for the king of the cranes had won that heart     with a crocodile's egg and a large fish-tart.     she vowed to marry the king of the cranes,     leaving the nile for stranger plains;     and away they flew in a gathering crowd     of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      and far away in the twilight sky     we heard them singing a lessening cry,--     farther and farther, till out of sight,     and we stood alone in the silent night!     often since, in the nights of june,     we sit on the sand and watch the moon,--      she has gone to the great gromboolian plain,     and we probably never shall meet again!     oft, in the long still nights of june,     we sit on the rocks and watch the moon,--     she dwells by the streams of the chankly bore.     and we probably never shall see her more.         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!

(here she twirled her fingers madly,)          but in england i've a mate!           yes! you've asked me far too late,           for in england i've a mate,       mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!       mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!                       vi.     mr. jones (his name is handel,--          handel jones, esquire, & co.)            dorking fowls delights to send,        mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!     keep, oh, keep your chairs and candle,     and your jug without a handle,--           i can merely be your friend!           should my jones more dorkings send,           i will give you three, my friend!       mr. yonghy-bongy-b\\u00f2!       mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!                       vii.     though you've such a tiny body,          and your head so large doth grow,--            though your hat may blow away,        mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!

      mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!                       viii.      down the slippery slopes of myrtle,         where the early pumpkins blow,           to the calm and silent sea        fled the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.     there, beyond the bay of gurtle,     lay a large and lively turtle.          you're the cove, he said, for me;           on your back beyond the sea,           turtle, you shall carry me!       said the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2,       said the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.                                       ix.      through the silent-roaring ocean         did the turtle swiftly go;           holding fast upon his shell       rode the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.     with a sad primaeval motion     towards the sunset isles of boshen           still the turtle bore him well.           holding fast upon his shell,          lady jingly jones, farewell!       sang the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2,       sang the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.                       x.      from the coast of coromandel         did that lady never go;           on that heap of stones she mourns       for the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.     on that coast of coromandel,     in his jug without a handle         still she weeps, and daily moans;         on that little heap of stones         to her dorking hens she moans,           for the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2,           for the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.     the pobble who has no toes.                        i.      the pobble who has no toes         had once as many as we;     when they said, some day you may lose them all;         he replied, fish fiddle de-dee!     and his aunt jobiska made him drink     lavender water tinged with pink;     for she said, the world in general knows     there's nothing so good for a pobble's toes!                       ii.      the pobble who has no toes,         swam across the bristol channel;     but before he set out he wrapped his nose         in a piece of scarlet flannel.     for his aunt jobiska said, no harm     can come to his toes if his nose is warm;     and it's perfectly known that a pobble's toes     are safe--provided he minds his nose.                       iii.      the pobble swam fast and well,         and when boats or ships came near him,     he tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell         so that all the world could hear him.     and all the sailors and admirals cried,     when they saw him nearing the further side,--    he has gone to fish, for his aunt jobiska's     runcible cat with crimson whiskers!                       iv.      but before he touched the shore,--         the shore of the bristol channel,     a sea-green porpoise carried away         his wrapper of scarlet flannel.     and when he came to observe his feet,     formerly garnished with toes so neat,     his face at once became forlorn     on perceiving that all his toes were gone!                       v.      and nobody ever knew,         from that dark day to the present,     whoso had taken the pobble's toes,         in a manner so far from pleasant.     whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,     or crafty mermaids stole them away,     nobody knew; and nobody knows     how the pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!                       vi.      the pobble who has no toes         was placed in a friendly bark,     and they rowed him back, and carried him up         to his aunt jobiska's park.     and she made him a feast, at his earnest wish,     of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;     and she said, it's a fact the whole world knows,     that pobbles are happier without their toes.     the new vestments.      there lived an old man in the kingdom of tess,     who invented a purely original dress;     and when it was perfectly made and complete,     he opened the door and walked into the street.      by way of a hat he'd a loaf of brown bread,     in the middle of which he inserted his head;     his shirt was made up of no end of dead mice,     the warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;     his drawers were of rabbit-skins, so were his shoes;     his stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;     his waistcoat and trowsers were made of pork chops;     his buttons were jujubes and chocolate drops;     his coat was all pancakes, with jam for a border,     and a girdle of biscuits to keep it in order;     and he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,     a cloak of green cabbage-leaves stitched all together.      he had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,     of all sorts of beasticles, birdlings, and boys;     and from every long street and dark lane in the town     beasts, birdies, and boys in a tumult rushed down.     two cows and a calf ate his cabbage-leaf cloak;     four apes seized his girdle, which vanished like smoke;     three kids ate up half of his pancaky coat,     and the tails were devour'd by an ancient he goat;     an army of dogs in a twinkling tore up his     pork waistcoat and trowsers to give to their puppies;     and while they were growling, and mumbling the chops,     ten boys prigged the jujubes and chocolate drops.     he tried to run back to his house, but in vain,     for scores of fat pigs came again and again:     they rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;     they tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;     and now from the housetops with screechings descend     striped, spotted, white, black, and gray cats without end:     they jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,     when crows, ducks, and hens made a mincemeat of that;     they speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,     and utterly tore up his shirt of dead mice;     they swallowed the last of his shirt with a squall,--     whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.      and he said to himself, as he bolted the door,    i will not wear a similar dress any more,     any more, any more, any more, never more!     mr. and mrs. discobbolos.                      i.      mr. and mrs. discobbolos         climbed to the top of a wall.       and they sate to watch the sunset sky,       and to hear the nupiter piffkin cry,         and the biscuit buffalo call.     they took up a roll and some camomile tea,     and both were as happy as happy could be,             till mrs. discobbolos said,--            oh! w! x! y! z!             it has just come into my head,       suppose we should happen to fall!!!!!                         darling mr. discobbolos!                       ii.     suppose we should fall down flumpetty,         just like pieces of stone,       on to the thorns, or into the moat,       what would become of your new green coat?         and might you not break a bone?     it never occurred to me before,     that perhaps we shall never go down any more!             and mrs. discobbolos said,            oh! w! x! y! z!             what put it into your head       to climb up this wall, my own                         darling mr. discobbolos?                       iii.      mr. discobbolos answered,        at first it gave me pain,       and i felt my ears turn perfectly pink       when your exclamation made me think         we might never get down again!     but now i believe it is wiser far     to remain for ever just where we are.             and mr. discobbolos said,            oh! w! x! y! z!             it has just come into my head       we shall never go down again,                         dearest mrs. discobbolos!                       iv.      so mr. and mrs. discobbolos         stood up and began to sing,--      far away from hurry and strife       here we will pass the rest of life,         ding a dong, ding dong, ding!     we want no knives nor forks nor chairs,     no tables nor carpets nor household cares;             from worry of life we've fled;             oh! w! x! y! z!             there is no more trouble ahead,       sorrow or any such thing,                         for mr. and mrs. discobbolos!     the quangle wangle's hat.                        i.      on the top of the crumpetty tree         the quangle wangle sat,     but his face you could not see,         on account of his beaver hat.     for his hat was a hundred and two feet wide,     with ribbons and bibbons on every side,     and bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,     so that nobody ever could see the face             of the quangle wangle quee.                       ii.      the quangle wangle said         to himself on the crumpetty tree,     jam, and jelly, and bread         are the best of food for me!     but the longer i live on this crumpetty tree     the plainer than ever it seems to me     that very few people come this way     and that life on the whole is far from gay!             said the quangle wangle quee.                       iii.      but there came to the crumpetty tree         mr. and mrs. canary;     and they said, did ever you see         any spot so charmingly airy?     may we build a nest on your lovely hat?     mr. quangle wangle, grant us that!     o please let us come and build a nest     of whatever material suits you best,             mr. quangle wangle quee!                       iv.      and besides, to the crumpetty tree         came the stork, the duck, and the owl;     the snail and the bumble-bee,         the frog and the fimble fowl     (the fimble fowl, with a corkscrew leg);     and all of them said, we humbly beg     we may build our homes on your lovely hat,--     mr. quangle wangle, grant us that!        mr. quangle wangle quee!                       v.      and the golden grouse came there,         and the pobble who has no toes,     and the small olympian bear,         and the dong with a luminous nose.     and the blue baboon who played the flute,     and the orient calf from the land of tute,     and the attery squash, and the bisky bat,--     all came and built on the lovely hat       of the quangle wangle quee.                      vi.      and the quangle wangle said         to himself on the crumpetty tree,     when all these creatures move         what a wonderful noise there'll be!     and at night by the light of the mulberry moon     they danced to the flute of the blue baboon,     on the broad green leaves of the crumpetty tree,     and all were as happy as happy could be,       with the quangle wangle quee.     the cummerbund. an indian poem.                      i.  she sate upon her dobie,     to watch the evening star, and all the punkahs, as they passed,     cried, my! how fair you are! around her bower, with quivering leaves,     the tall kamsamahs grew, and kitmutgars in wild festoons     hung down from tchokis blue.                       ii.  below her home the river rolled     with soft meloobious sound, where golden-finned chuprassies swam,     in myriads circling round. above, on tallest trees remote     green ayahs perched alone, and all night long the mussak moan'd     its melancholy tone.                       iii.  and where the purple nullahs threw     their branches far and wide, and silvery goreewallahs flew     in silence, side by side, the little bheesties' twittering cry     rose on the flagrant air, and oft the angry jampan howled     deep in his hateful lair.                       iv.  she sate upon her dobie,     she heard the nimmak hum, when all at once a cry arose,     the cummerbund is come!

 eggs and butter and cake, mr. wolf.  where are you going with them, little red riding hood?  i am going to my grandmother, who is ill, mr. wolf.  where does your grandmother live, little red riding hood?  along that path, past the wild rose bushes, then through the gate at the end of the wood, mr. wolf.  then mr. wolf again said good morning and set off, and little red riding hood again went in search of wild flowers.  at last he reached the porch covered with flowers and knocked at the door of the cottage.  who is there? called the grandmother.  little red riding hood, said the wicked wolf.  press the latch, open the door, and walk in, said the grandmother.  the wolf pressed the latch, and walked in where the grandmother lay in bed. he made one jump at her, but she jumped out of bed into a closet. then the wolf put on the cap which she had dropped and crept under the bedclothes.  in a short while little red riding hood knocked at the door, and walked in, saying, good morning, grandmother, i have brought you eggs, butter and cake, and here is a bunch of flowers i gathered in the wood. as she came nearer the bed she said, what big ears you have, grandmother.  all the better to hear you with, my dear.  what big eyes you have, grandmother.  all the better to see you with, my dear.  but, grandmother, what a big nose you have.  all the better to smell with, my dear.  but, grandmother, what a big mouth you have.  all the better to eat you up with, my dear, he said as he sprang at little red riding hood.  just at that moment little red riding hood's father was passing the cottage and heard her scream. he rushed in and with his axe chopped off mr. wolf's head.  everybody was happy that little red riding hood had escaped the wolf. then little red riding hood's father carried her home and they lived happily ever after.     the goose-girl   there was once an old queen who had a very beautiful daughter. the time came when the maiden was to go into a distant country to be married. the old queen packed up everything suitable to a royal outfit.  she also sent a waiting-woman with her. when the hour of departure came they bade each other a sorrowful farewell and set out for the bridegroom's country.  when they had ridden for a time the princess became very thirsty, and said to the waiting-woman, go down and fetch me some water in my cup from the stream. i must have something to drink.  if you are thirsty, said the waiting-woman, dismount yourself, lie down by the water and drink. i don't choose to be your servant.  being very thirsty, the princess dismounted, and knelt by the flowing water.  now, when she was about to mount her horse again, the waiting-woman said, by rights your horse belongs to me; this jade will do for you!  the poor little princess was obliged to give way. then the waiting-woman, in a harsh voice, ordered her to take off her royal robes, and to put on her own mean garments. finally she forced her to swear that she would not tell a person at the court what had taken place. had she not taken the oath she would have been killed on the spot.  there was great rejoicing when they arrived at the castle. the prince hurried towards them, and lifted the waiting-woman from her horse, thinking she was his bride. she was led upstairs, but the real princess had to stay below.  the old king looked out of the window and saw the delicate, pretty little creature standing in the courtyard; so he asked the bride about her companion.  i picked her up on the way, and brought her with me for company. give the girl something to do to keep her from idling.  the old king said, i have a little lad who looks after the geese; she may help him.  the boy was called little conrad, and the real bride was sent with him to look after the geese. when they reached the meadow, the princess sat down on the grass and let down her hair, and when conrad saw it he was so delighted that he wanted to pluck some out; but she said--    blow, blow, little breeze,   and conrad's hat seize.   let him join in the chase   while away it is whirled,   till my tresses are curled   and i rest in my place.  then a strong wind sprang up, which blew away conrad's hat right over the fields, and he had to run after it. when he came back her hair was all put up again.  when they got home conrad went to the king and said, i won't tend the geese with that maiden again.  why not? asked the king.  then conrad went on to tell the king all that had happened in the field. the king ordered conrad to go next day as usual and he followed into the field and hid behind a bush. he saw it happen just as conrad had told him. thereupon he went away unnoticed; and in the evening, when the goose-girl came home, he asked her why she did all these things.  that i may not tell you, she answered.  then he said, if you won't tell me, then tell the iron stove there; and he went away.  she crept up to the stove and unburdened her heart to it. the king stood outside by the pipes of the stove and heard all she said. then he came back, and caused royal robes to be put upon her, and her beauty was a marvel. then he called his son and told him that he had a false bride, but that the true bride was here.  the prince was charmed with her beauty and a great banquet was prepared. the bridegroom sat at the head of the table, with the princess on one side and the waiting-woman at the other; but she did not recognize the princess.  when they had eaten, the king put a riddle to the waiting-woman. what does a person deserve that deceives his master? telling the whole story.  the false bride answered, he must be put into a barrel and dragged along by two white horses till he is dead.  that is your doom, said the king, and the judgment shall be carried out.  when the sentence was fulfilled, the young prince married his true bride, and they lived together in peace and happiness.     babes in the wood   once upon a time there lived two little children whose parents were ill unto death. they begged their brother to care for the two little ones as he would his own.  the uncle promised he would be a father to them, but he soon began to scheme to possess the money the parents had left in his care for the children. he sent for two robbers and bargained with them to take the two babes into the woods and kill them.  after going many miles into the woods one of the robbers said, let us not kill the little children, they never harmed us. the other robber would not consent, so they came to blows. this frightened the children so much that they ran away and did not see the robbers again.  they wandered on and on until they became so tired and hungry that at length they sat down at the foot of a tree and cried as if their hearts would break. the little birds heard them and began to trill sweet lullabies, which presently lulled them to rest.  the birdies knew that the children would die of cold and hunger, so they covered them with leaves of crimson and brown and green. they then told the angels in heaven the sad story of the lost babes, and one of the white-robed angels flew down to earth and carried both the little ones back to heaven, so that when they awoke they were no longer tired and hungry, but were again with their dear mother.     the sleeping beauty   once upon a time there was a king and queen who for a very long time had no children, and when at length a little daughter was born to them they were so pleased that they gave a christening feast to which they invited a number of fairies. but, unfortunately, they left out one rather cross old fairy, and she was so angry that she said the princess should die when she reached the age of sixteen, by pricking her hand with a spindle.  all the other fairies present, except one, had already given the princess their beautiful gifts, and this last one said she could not prevent part of the wicked wish coming true; but her gift should be that the princess should not really die, but only fall into a deep sleep, which should last for a hundred years, and at the end of that time she should be awakened by a king's son.  it all happened as the fairies had predicted. when the princess was sixteen years old she saw an old woman spinning and took the spindle from her to try this strange new work. instantly she pricked her hand and fell into a deep sleep, as did everyone else in the palace. there she lay in a bower of roses, year after year, and the hedge around the palace garden grew so tall and thick that at last you could not have told that there was a castle at all.  at the end of the hundred years a king's son heard of the castle and the enchanted princess who lay asleep there and determined to rescue her. so he cut his way through the thick prickly hedge and at length he came to the princess. when he saw how lovely and how sweet she looked he fell in love with her and, stooping, kissed her lips.  at once she awoke and with her the king and queen and all the courtiers, who had fallen asleep at the same time.  as the princess was as much taken with the prince's appearance as he was with hers, they decided to be married. and so the wedding was celebrated the same day with great pomp and ceremony.     snowdrop and seven little dwarfs   once upon a time there was a little princess called snowdrop, who had a cruel step-mother who was jealous of her. the queen had a magic mirror, which could speak to her, and when she looked into it and asked who was the fairest lady in the land the mirror told her she was, for she was very beautiful; but as snowdrop grew up she became still more lovely than her step-mother and the mirror did not fail to tell the queen this.  so she ordered one of her huntsmen to take snowdrop away and kill her; but he was too tender-hearted to do this and left the maiden in the wood and went home again. snowdrop wandered about until she came to the house of seven little dwarfs, and they were so kind as to take her in and let her live with them. she used to make their seven little beds, and prepare the meals for the seven little men, and they were all quite happy until the queen found out from her mirror that snowdrop was alive still, for, as it always told the truth, it still told her snowdrop was the fairest lady in the land.  she decided that snowdrop must die, so she dyed her face and dressed up like an old pedlar, and in this disguise she went to the home of the seven dwarfs and called out, laces for sale.  snowdrop peeped out of the window and said, good-day, mother; what have you to sell?  good laces, fine laces, laces of every color, and she held out one that was made of gay silk.  snowdrop opened the door and bought the pretty lace.  child, said the old woman, you are a sight, let me lace you properly for once.  snowdrop placed herself before the old woman, who laced her so quickly and so tightly that she took away snowdrop's breath and she fell down as though dead.  not long after the seven dwarfs came home they found that she was laced too tight and cut the lace, whereupon snowdrop began to breathe and soon came back to life again.  when the queen got home and found by asking her mirror that snowdrop was still alive, she planned to make an end of her for good, so she made a poisoned comb and disguised herself to look like a different old woman.  she journeyed to the dwarfs' home and induced snowdrop to let her comb her hair. the minute she put the poisoned comb in her hair snowdrop fell down as though dead.  when the seven dwarfs came home they found their poor snowdrop on the floor, and suspecting the bad queen began to look for the cause, soon finding the comb. no sooner had they removed it than snowdrop came to life again.  upon the queen's return home she found by asking her mirror that snowdrop still lived, so she disguised herself a third time and came to the dwarfs' little house and gave snowdrop a poisoned apple. as soon as the little princess took a bite it stuck in her throat and choked her.  oh! how grieved were the good little dwarfs. they made a fine glass coffin, and put snowdrop into it and were carrying her away to bury her when they met a prince, who fell in love with the little dead maiden, and begged the dwarfs to give her to him.  the dwarfs were so sorry for him they consented, and the prince's servants were about to carry the coffin away when they stumbled and fell over the root of a tree. snowdrop received such a violent jerk that the poisonous apple was jerked right out of her throat and she sat up alive and well again.  of course she married the prince, and she, her husband and the good little dwarfs lived happily ever after, but the cruel step-mother came to a bad end, and no one was even sorry for her.\",\n          \"one morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.  he pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.  a gig was coming along the road; it was driven by mr. mcgregor, and beside him sat mrs. mcgregor in her best bonnet.  as soon as they had passed, little benjamin bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of mr. mcgregor's garden.      that wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived benjamin's aunt and his cousins--flopsy, mopsy, cotton-tail, and peter.  old mrs. rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (i once bought a pair at a bazaar). she also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).  little benjamin did not very much want to see his aunt.  he came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin peter.      peter was sitting by himself. he looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.  peter, said little benjamin, in a whisper, who has got your clothes?  peter replied, the scarecrow in mr. mcgregor's garden, and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.  little benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that mr. mcgregor had gone out in a gig, and mrs. mcgregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.      peter said he hoped that it would rain.  at this point old mrs. rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: cotton-tail! cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!  peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.  they went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. from here they looked down into mr. mcgregor's garden. peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of mr. mcgregor's.      little benjamin said: it spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.  peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.  it had been sown with lettuces.  they left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little benjamin, who was wearing clogs.      little benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.  they took them off the scarecrow. there had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.  benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.  then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his aunt.  peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.       benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. he said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their sunday dinner.  (the name of little benjamin's papa was old mr. benjamin bunny.)  the lettuces certainly were very fine.  peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. presently he dropped half the onions.      little benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. he led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. they went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.  the mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at peter rabbit and little benjamin bunny.  presently peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.      they got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!  he was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.  this is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!  little benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and peter and the onions underneath a large basket....      the cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.  perhaps she liked the smell of onions!  anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.  she sat there for five hours.                                       i cannot draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry.  the sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.      at length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.  the cat looked up and saw old mr. benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.  he was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.  he was looking for his son.  old mr. bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.  he took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.  the cat was too much surprised to scratch back.      when old mr. bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.  then he came back to the basket and took out his son benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.  then he took out his nephew peter.  then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.    when mr. mcgregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.  it looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!  also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse, locking the door upon the outside.      when peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. cotton-tail and peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old mrs. rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco. a farmyard tale     for     ralph and betsy      what a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!  --listen to the story of jemima puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.    her sister-in-law, mrs. rebeccah puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else--i have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, jemima. you would let them go cold; you know you would!  i wish to hatch my own eggs; i will hatch them all by myself, quacked jemima puddle-duck.    she tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.  jemima puddle-duck became quite desperate. she determined to make a nest right away from the farm.    she set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill.  she was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.    when she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.  she thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.    jemima puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. she ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.    she flew beautifully when she had got a good start.  she skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.    jemima alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place. she rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves.  but--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.  he had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.  quack? said jemima puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side--quack?    the gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at jemima--  madam, have you lost your way? said he. he had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.  jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. she explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place.    ah! is that so? indeed! said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at jemima. he folded up the newspaper, and put it in his coat-tail pocket.  jemima complained of the superfluous hen.  indeed! how interesting! i wish i could meet with that fowl. i would teach it to mind its own business!    but as to a nest--there is no difficulty: i have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. no, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. you may sit there as long as you like, said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.  he led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves.  it was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.    this is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient, said the hospitable gentleman.  there was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes. the gentleman opened the door, and showed jemima in.    the shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.  jemima puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. but it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.    when she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.  he was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let jemima go home for the night. he promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day.  he said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed.    jemima puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. they were greeny white and very large. the foxy gentleman admired them immensely. he used to turn them over and count them when jemima was not there.  at last jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--and i will bring a bag of corn with me, so that i need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. they might catch cold, said the conscientious jemima.    madam, i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; i will provide oats. but before you commence your tedious sitting, i intend to give you a treat. let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!  may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. i will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelette, said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.    jemima puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.  she went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.    and she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.  the collie-dog kep met her coming out, what are you doing with those onions? where do you go every afternoon by yourself, jemima puddle-duck?  jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.  the collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.    he asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed.  then he went out, and trotted down the village. he went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.    jemima puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. she was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.  she flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.    he was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. when jemima alighted he quite jumped.  come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. give me the herbs for the omelette. be sharp!  he was rather abrupt. jemima puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.  she felt surprised, and uncomfortable.    while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it.  jemima became much alarmed.    a moment afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans.  and nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.  presently kep opened the door of the shed, and let out jemima puddle-duck.    unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.  he had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.    jemima puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.    she laid some more in june, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched.  jemima puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter. once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie, who lived at a farm called little-town. she was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!  one day little lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so! i've lost my pocket-handkin! three handkins and a pinny! have you seen them, tabby kitten?    the kitten went on washing her white paws; so lucie asked a speckled hen--  sally henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins?  but the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--  i go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!      and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig.  cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.  lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  and a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.    lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!    presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.  some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! and where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a very small person.  lucie ran on, and on.    the path ended under a big rock. the grass was short and green, and there were clothes--props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  but there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      lily-white and clean, oh!      with little frills between, oh!       smooth and hot--red rusty spot      never here be seen, oh!    lucie, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. a little frightened voice called out who's that?  lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. only the ceiling was so low that lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.    there was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at lucie.  her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where lucie had yellow curls--that little person had prickles!    who are you? said lucie. have you seen my pocket-handkins?  the little person made a bob-curtsey--oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is mrs. tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, i'm an excellent clear-starcher! and she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.    what's that thing? said lucie--that's not my pocket-handkin?  oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to cock robin!  and she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.    then she took something else off a clothes-horse--  that isn't my pinny? said lucie.  oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to jenny wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! it's very bad to wash! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    mrs. tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.    there's one of my pocket-handkins! cried lucie--and there's my pinny!  mrs. tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.  oh that is lovely! said lucie.    and what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?  oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to sally henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! she'll very soon go barefoot! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    why, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?  oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old mrs. rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! i've had to wash it separately, i can't get out the smell.  there's another one of mine, said lucie.    what are those funny little white things?  that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten; i only have to iron them; she washes them herself.  there's my last pocket-handkin! said lucie.    and what are you dipping into the basin of starch?  they're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to tom titmouse--most terrible particular! said mrs. tiggy-winkle. now i've finished my ironing; i'm going to air some clothes.    what are these dear soft fluffy things? said lucie.  oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at skelghyl.  will their jackets take off? asked lucie.  oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. and here's one marked for gatesgarth, and three that come from little-town. they're always marked at washing! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!    then mrs. tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for lucie. they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. mrs. tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that lucie didn't like to sit too near her.    when they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.  and then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.    then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs. tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!  all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny!    and she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs. tiggy-winkle.    so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except lucie's one little bundle.    lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say good-night, and to thank the washer-woman--but what a very odd thing! mrs. tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!  she was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?    and how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with prickles!  why! mrs. tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog.                                           (now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the     stile--but then how could she have found three clean     pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?      and besides--i have seen that door into the back of the hill     called cat bells--and besides i am very well acquainted with     dear mrs. tiggy-winkle!) once upon a time there were four little rabbits, and their names were--            flopsy,        mopsy,    cotton-tail, and peter.  they lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.  'now my dears,' said old mrs. rabbit one morning, 'you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into mr. mcgregor's garden: your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by mrs. mcgregor.'  'now run along, and don't get into mischief. i am going out.'  then old mrs. rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.  flopsy, mopsy, and cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries:  but peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to mr. mcgregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!  first he ate some lettuces and some french beans; and then he ate some radishes;  and then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.  but round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but mr. mcgregor!  mr. mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after peter, waving a rake and calling out, 'stop thief!'  peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.  he lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.  after losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that i think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. it was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.  peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.  mr. mcgregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of peter; but peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.  and rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.  mr. mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. he began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.  presently peter sneezed--'kertyschoo!' mr. mcgregor was after him in no time.  and tried to put his foot upon peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. the window was too small for mr. mcgregor, and he was tired of running after peter. he went back to his work.  peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. also he was very damp with sitting in that can.  after a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all round.  he found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.  an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. she only shook her head at him. peter began to cry.  then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. presently, he came to a pond where mr. mcgregor filled his water-cans. a white cat was staring at some gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little benjamin bunny.  he went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. peter scuttered underneath the bushes. but presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. the first thing he saw was mr. mcgregor hoeing onions. his back was turned towards peter, and beyond him was the gate!  peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.  mr. mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner, but peter did not care. he slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.  mr. mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.  peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.  he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. his mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight!  i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening.  his mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to peter!  'one table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'  but flopsy, mopsy, and cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper. this is a tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was nutkin.  he had a brother called twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.    in the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called old brown.    one autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green--nutkin and twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.    they made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to owl island to gather nuts.  each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.    they also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for old brown, and put them down upon his door-step.  then twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--  old mr. brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?    but nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. he bobbed up and down like a little red cherry, singing--      riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!      a little wee man, in a red red coat!      a staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;      if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a groat.  now this riddle is as old as the hills; mr. brown paid no attention whatever to nutkin.  he shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.    but next morning they all came back again to owl island; and twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of old brown's doorway, and said--  mr. brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?    but nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old mr. brown with a nettle and singing--      old mr. b! riddle-me-ree!      hitty pitty within the wall,      hitty pitty without the wall;      if you touch hitty pitty,      hitty pitty will bite you!  mr. brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.    he shut the door in nutkin's face. presently a little thread of blue smoke from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--      a house full, a hole full!      and you cannot gather a bowl-full!      the squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.  but nutkin gathered oak-apples--yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old mr. brown.    on the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for old brown.  they paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on owl island.    twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. he ran in front, singing--      the man in the wilderness said to me,     'how many strawberries grow in the sea?'      i answered him as i thought good--      'as many red herrings as grow in the wood.'  but old mr. brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.    on the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in plum-pudding for old brown. each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.  but nutkin sang as rudely as ever--       old mr. b! riddle-me-ree       flour of england, fruit of spain,       met together in a shower of rain;       put in a bag tied round with a string,     if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a ring!   which was ridiculous of nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to old brown.    the other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but nutkin gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins.    on the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. they had stolen it out of a bumble bees' nest on the tippitty top of the hill.  but nutkin skipped up and down, singing--      hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! hum-a-bum buzz!       as i went over tipple-tine       i met a flock of bonny swine;     some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!       they were the very bonniest swine       that e'er went over tipple-tine.    old mr. brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of nutkin.  but he ate up the honey!    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.  but nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.    on the sixth day, which was saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid egg in a little rush basket as a last parting present for old brown.  but nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--      humpty dumpty lies in the beck,      with a white counterpane round his neck,      forty doctors and forty wrights,      cannot put humpty dumpty to rights!    now old mr. brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. but still he did not speak.    nutkin became more and more impertinent--        old mr. b! old mr. b!     hickamore, hackamore, on the king's kitchen door;     all the king's horses, and all the king's men,     couldn't drive hickamore, hackamore,     off the king's kitchen door.  nutkin danced up and down like a sunbeam; but still old brown said nothing at all.    nutkin began again--      arthur o'bower has broken his band,      he comes roaring up the land!      the king of scots with all his power,      cannot turn arthur of the bower!  nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the wind, and he took a running jump right onto the head of old brown!...  then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud squeak!  the other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.    when they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree--there was old brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.                                       but nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!    this looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.    old brown carried nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic window.    and to this day, if you meet nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--  cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k! once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were mittens, tom kitten, and moppet.  they had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.  but one day their mother--mrs. tabitha twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.      first she scrubbed their faces (this one is moppet).  then she brushed their fur, (this one is mittens).      then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is tom kitten).  tom was very naughty, and he scratched.  mrs. tabitha dressed moppet and mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son thomas.      tom kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. his mother sewed them on again.  when the three kittens were ready, mrs. tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.  now keep your frocks clean, children! you must walk on your hind legs. keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from sally henny penny, and from the pig-stye and the puddle-ducks.      moppet and mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.  when they stood up there were several green smears!  let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall, said moppet.  they turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.      tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. he came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left.  he was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.  moppet and mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.      while they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step--pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!  they stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. they had very small eyes and looked surprised.      then the two duck-birds, rebeccah and jemima puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.  mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. moppet and tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of tom's clothes came off on the way down.  come! mr. drake puddle-duck, said moppet--come and help us to dress him! come and button up tom!      mr. drake puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles.  but he put them on himself! they fitted him even worse than tom kitten.  it's a very fine morning! said mr. drake puddle-duck.      and he and jemima and rebeccah puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!  then tabitha twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.      she pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.  my friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; i am affronted, said mrs. tabitha twitchit.  she sent them upstairs; and i am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true.      quite the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least.  somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.  and i think that some day i shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about tom kitten!    as for the puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.  the clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.      and mr. drake puddle-duck, and jemima and rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.\",\n          \"the following lines by mr. lear were written for a young lady of his acquaintance, who had quoted to him the words of a young lady not of his acquaintance,    how pleasant to know mr. lear!        how pleasant to know mr. lear!         who has written such volumes of stuff!       some think him ill-tempered and queer,         but a few think him pleasant enough.        his mind is concrete and fastidious,         his nose is remarkably big;       his visage is more or less hideous,         his beard it resembles a wig.        he has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers,         leastways if you reckon two thumbs;       long ago he was one of the singers,         but now he is one of the dumbs.        he sits in a beautiful parlor,         with hundreds of books on the wall;       he drinks a great deal of marsala,         but never gets tipsy at all.        he has many friends, lay men and clerical,         old foss is the name of his cat;       his body is perfectly spherical,         he weareth a runcible hat.        when he walks in waterproof white,         the children run after him so!       calling out, he's come out in his night-         gown, that crazy old englishman, oh!        he weeps by the side of the ocean,         he weeps on the top of the hill;       he purchases pancakes and lotion,         and chocolate shrimps from the mill.        he reads, but he cannot speak, spanish,         he cannot abide ginger beer:       ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,         how pleasant to know mr. lear!                                              introduction.  edward lear, the artist, author of journals of a landscape painter in various out-of-the-way countries, and of the delightful books of nonsense, which have amused successive generations of children, died on sunday, january 29, 1888, at san remo, italy, where he had lived for twenty years. few names could evoke a wider expression of passing regret at their appearance in the obituary column; for until his health began to fail he was known to an immense and almost a cosmopolitan circle of acquaintance, and popular wherever he was known. fewer still could call up in the minds of intimate friends a deeper and more enduring feeling of sorrow for personal loss, mingled with the pleasantest of memories; for it was impossible to know him thoroughly and not to love him. london, rome, the mediterranean countries generally, ceylon and india, are still all dotted with survivors among his generation who will mourn for him affectionately, although his latter years were spent in comparatively close retirement. he was a man of striking nobility of nature, fearless, independent, energetic, given to forming for himself strong opinions, often hastily, sometimes bitterly; not always strong or sound in judgment, but always seeking after truth in every matter, and following it as he understood it in scorn of consequence; utterly unselfish, devoted to his friends, generous even to extravagance towards any one who had ever been connected with his fortunes or his travels; playful, light-hearted, witty, and humorous, but not without those occasional fits of black depression and nervous irritability to which such temperaments are liable.  great and varied as the merits of his pictures are, lear hardly succeeded in achieving any great popularity as a landscape-painter. his work was frequently done on private commission, and he rarely sent in pictures for the academy or other exhibitions. his larger and more highly finished landscapes were unequal in technical perfection,--sometimes harsh or cold in color, or stiff in composition; sometimes full of imagination, at others literal and prosaic,--but always impressive reproductions of interesting or peculiar scenery. in later years he used in conversation to qualify himself as a topographical artist; and the definition was true, though not exhaustive. he had an intuitive and a perfectly trained eye for the character and beauty of distant mountain lines, the solemnity of rocky gorges, the majesty of a single mountain rising from a base of plain or sea; and he was equally exact in rendering the true forms of the middle distances and the specialties of foreground detail belonging to the various lands through which he had wandered as a sketcher. some of his pictures show a mastery which has rarely been equalled over the difficulties of painting an immense plain as seen from a height, reaching straight away from the eye of the spectator until it is lost in a dim horizon. sir roderick murchison used to say that he always understood the geological peculiarities of a country he had only studied in lear's sketches. the compliment was thoroughly justified; and it is not every landscape-painter to whom it could honestly be paid.  the history of lear's choice of a career was a curious one. he was the youngest of twenty-one children, and, through a family mischance, was thrown entirely on the limited resources of an elderly sister at a very early age. as a boy he had always dabbled in colors for his own amusement, and had been given to poring over the ordinary boys' books upon natural history. it occurred to him to try to turn his infant talents to account; and he painted upon cardboard a couple of birds in the style which the older among us remember as having been called oriental tinting, took them to a small shop, and sold them for fourpence. the kindness of friends, to whom he was ever grateful, gave him the opportunity of more serious and more remunerative study, and he became a patient and accurate zo\\u00f6logical draughtsman. many of the birds in the earlier volumes of gould's magnificent folios were drawn for him by lear. a few years back there were eagles alive in the zo\\u00f6logical gardens in regent's park to which lear could point as old familiar friends that he had drawn laboriously from claw to beak fifty years before. he united with this kind of work the more unpleasant occupation of drawing the curiosities of disease or deformity in hospitals. one day, as he was busily intent on the portrait of a bird in the zo\\u00f6logical gardens, an old gentleman came and looked over his shoulder, entered into conversation, and finally said to him, you must come and draw my birds at knowsley. lear did not know where knowsley was, or what it meant; but the old gentleman was the thirteenth earl of derby. the successive earls of derby have been among lear's kindest and most generous patrons. he went to knowsley, and the drawings in the knowsley menagerie (now a rare and highly-prized work among book collectors) are by lear's hand. at knowsley he became a permanent favorite; and it was there that he composed in prolific succession his charming and wonderful series of utterly nonsensical rhymes and drawings. lear had already begun seriously to study landscape. when english winters began to threaten his health, lord derby started a subscription which enabled him to go to rome as a student and artist, and no doubt gave him recommendations among anglo-roman society which laid the foundations of a numerous client\\u00e8le. it was in the roman summers that lear first began to exercise the taste for pictorial wandering which grew into a habit and a passion, to fill vivid and copious note-books as he went, and to illustrate them by spirited and accurate drawings; and his first volume of illustrated excursions in italy, published in 1846, is gratefully dedicated to his knowsley patron.  only those who have travelled with him could know what a delightful comrade he was to men whose tastes ran more or less parallel to his own. it was not everybody who could travel with him; for he was so irrepressibly anxious not to lose a moment of the time at his disposal for gathering into his garners the beauty and interest of the lands over which he journeyed, that he was careless of comfort and health. calabria, sicily, the desert of sinai, egypt and nubia, greece and albania, palestine, syria, athos, candia, montenegro, zag\\u00f3ri (who knows now where zag\\u00f3ri is, or was?), were as thoroughly explored and sketched by him as the more civilized localities of malta, corsica, and corfu. he read insatiably before starting all the recognized guide-books and histories of the country he intended to draw; and his published itineraries are marked by great strength and literary interest quite irrespectively of the illustrations. and he had his reward. it is not any ordinary journalist and sketcher who could have compelled from tennyson such a tribute as lines to e.l. on his travels in greece:--      illyrian woodlands, echoing falls       of water, sheets of summer glass,       the long divine pene\\u00efan pass,     the vast akrokeraunian walls,      tomohrit, athos, all things fair,       with such a pencil, such a pen,       you shadow forth to distant men,     i read and felt that i was there.  lear was a man to whom, as to tennyson's ulysses,      all experience is an arch wherethrough     gleams that untravelled world.  after settling at san remo, and when he was nearly sixty years old, he determined to visit india and ceylon. he started once and failed, being taken so ill at suez that he was obliged to return. the next year he succeeded, and brought away some thousands of drawings of the most striking views from all three presidencies and from the tropical island. his appetite for travel continued to grow with what it fed upon; and although he hated a long sea-voyage, he used seriously to contemplate as possible a visit to relations in new zealand. it may safely, however, be averred that no considerations would have tempted him to visit the arctic regions.      a hard-working life, checkered by the odd adventures which happen     to the odd and the adventurous and pass over the commonplace; a     career brightened by the high appreciation of unimpeachable     critics; lightened, till of late, by the pleasant society and good     wishes of innumerable friends; saddened by the growing pressure of     ill health and solitude; cheered by his constant trust in the love     and sympathy of those who knew him best, however far away,--such     was the life of edward lear.        --the london saturday review, feb. 4, 1888.  among the writers who have striven with varying success during the last thirty or forty years to awaken the merriment of the rising generation of the time being, mr. edward lear occupies the first place in seniority, if not in merit. the parent of modern nonsense-writers, he is distinguished from all his followers and imitators by the superior consistency with which he has adhered to his aim,--that of amusing his readers by fantastic absurdities, as void of vulgarity or cynicism as they are incapable of being made to harbor any symbolical meaning. he never deviates into sense; but those who appreciate him never feel the need of such deviation. he has a genius for coining absurd names and words, which, even when they are suggested by the exigencies of his metre, have a ludicrous appropriateness to the matter in hand. his verse is, with the exception of a certain number of cockney rhymes, wonderfully flowing and even melodious--or, as he would say, meloobious--while to all these qualifications for his task must finally be added the happy gift of pictorial expression, enabling him to double, nay, often to quadruple, the laughable effect of his text by an inexhaustible profusion of the quaintest designs. generally speaking, these designs are, as it were, an idealization of the efforts of a clever child; but now and then--as in the case of the nonsense-botany--mr. lear reminds us what a genuine and graceful artist he really is. the advantage to a humorist of being able to illustrate his own text has been shown in the case of thackeray and mr. w.s. gilbert, to mention two familiar examples; but in no other instance of such a combination have we discovered such geniality as is to be found in the nonsense-pictures of mr. lear. we have spoken above of the melodiousness of mr. lear's verses, a quality which renders them excellently suitable for musical setting, and which has not escaped the notice of the author himself. we have also heard effective arrangements, presumably by other composers, of the adventures of the table and the chair, and of the cruise of the owl and the pussy-cat,--the latter introduced into the drawing-room entertainment of one of the followers of john parry. indeed, in these days of adaptations, it is to be wondered at that no enterprising librettist has attempted to build a children's comic opera out of the materials supplied in the four books with which we are now concerned. the first of these, originally published in 1846, and brought out in an enlarged form in 1863, is exclusively devoted to nonsense-verses of one type. mr. lear is careful to disclaim the credit of having created this type, for he tells us in the preface to his third book that the lines beginning, 'there was an old man of tobago,' were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse leading itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures. dismissing the further question of the authorship of there was an old man of tobago, we propose to give a few specimens of mr. lear's protean powers as exhibited in the variation of this simple type. here, to begin with, is a favorite verse, which we are very glad to have an opportunity of giving, as it is often incorrectly quoted, cocks being substituted for owls in the third line:      there was an old man with a beard,     who said, 'it is just as i feared!     two owls and a hen, four larks and a wren,     have all built their nests in my beard!'  with the kindly fatalism which is the distinctive note of the foregoing stanza, the sentiment of our next extract is in vivid contrast:--       there was an old man in a tree,     who was terribly bored by a bee;     when they said, 'does it buzz?' he replied, 'yes, it does!     it's a regular brute of a bee.'  to the foregoing verse an historic interest attaches, if, that is, we are right in supposing it to have inspired mr. gilbert with his famous nonsense-rhyme in blank verse. we quote from memory:--      there was an old man of st. bees,     who was stung in the arm by a wasp.     when they asked, 'does it hurt?' he replied, 'no, it doesn't,     but i thought all the while 'twas a hornet!'  passing over the lines referring to the young person of crete to whom the epithet ombliferous is applied, we may be pardoned--on the ground of the geographical proximity of the two countries named--for quoting together two stanzas which in reality are separated by a good many pages:--      there was a young lady of norway,     who casually sat in a doorway;     when the doors queezed her flat, she exclaimed, 'what of that?'     this courageous young person of norway.      there was a young lady of sweden,     who went by the slow train to weedon;     when they cried, 'weedon station!' she made no observation,     but thought she should go back to sweden.  a noticeable feature about this first book, and one which we think is peculiar to it, is the harsh treatment which the eccentricities of the inhabitants of certain towns appear to have met with at the hands of their fellow-residents. no less than three people are smashed,--the old man of whitehaven who danced a quadrille with a raven; the old person of buda; and the old man with a gong who bumped at it all the day long, though in the last-named case we admit that there was considerable provocation. before quitting the first nonsense-book, we would point out that it contains one or two forms that are interesting; for instance, scroobious, which we take to be a portmanteau word, and spickle-speckled, a favorite form of reduplication with mr. lear, and of which the best specimen occurs in his last book, he tinkledy-binkledy-winkled the bell. the second book, published in 1871, shows mr. lear in the maturity of sweet desipience, and will perhaps remain the favorite volume of the four to grown-up readers. the nonsense-songs are all good, and the story of the four little children who went round the world is the most exquisite piece of imaginative absurdity that the present writer is acquainted with. but before coming to that, let us quote a few lines from the jumblies, who, as all the world knows, went to sea in a sieve:--        they sailed to the western sea, they did,       to a land all covered with trees.     and they bought an owl, and a useful cart,     and a pound of rice, and a cranberry tart,       and a hive of silvery bees.     and they bought a pig, and some green jack-daws,     and a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,     and forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,       and no end of stilton cheese.         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live.         their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.     and in twenty years they all came back,       in twenty years or more,     and every one said, 'how tall they've grown!     for they've been to the lakes, and the torrible zone,       and the hills of the chankly bore.'  from the pedestrian excursion of the table and the chair, we cannot resist making a brief quotation, though in this, as in every case, the inability to quote the drawings also is a sad drawback:--      so they both went slowly down,     and walked about the town,     with a cheerful bumpy sound,     as they toddled round and round.     and everybody cried,     as they hastened to their side,     'see, the table and the chair     have come out to take the air!'      but in going down an alley     to a castle in a valley,     they completely lost their way,     and wandered all the day,     till, to see them safely back,     they paid a ducky-quack,     and a beetle and a mouse,     who took them to their house.      then they whispered to each other,     'o delightful little brother,     what a lovely walk we've taken!     let us dine on beans and bacon!'     so the ducky and the leetle     browny-mousy, and the beetle     dined, and danced upon their heads,     till they toddled to their beds.  the story of the four little children who went round the world follows next, and the account of the manner in which they occupied themselves while on shipboard may be transcribed for the benefit of those unfortunate persons who have not perused the original: during the day-time violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt-water into a churn, while her three brothers churned it violently in the hope it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did. after journeying for a time, they saw some land at a distance, and when they came to it they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. besides that it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses with a great gulf-stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, five hundred and three feet high. in a later passage, we read how by-and-by the children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. each of these blue bottles contained a bluebottlefly, and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony, nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. our last quotation from this inimitable recital shall be from the description of their adventure on a great plain where they espied an object which on a nearer approach and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cake and oyster-shells. this turned out to be the co-operative cauliflower, who, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust ... suddenly arose, and in a somewhat plumdomphious manner hurried off towards the setting sun, his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers ... till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand. so remarkable a sight of course impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.  in his third book, mr. lear takes occasion in an entertaining preface to repudiate the charge of harboring any ulterior motive beyond that of nonsense pure and absolute in any of his verses or pictures, and tells a delightful anecdote illustrative of the persistently absurd report that the earl of derby was the author of the first book of nonsense. in this volume he reverts once more to the familiar form adopted in his original efforts, and with little falling off. it is to be remarked that the third division is styled twenty-six nonsense rhymes and pictures, although there is no more rhyme than reason in any of the set. our favorite illustrations are those of the scroobious snake who always wore a hat on his head, for fear he should bite anybody, and the visibly vicious vulture who wrote some verses to a veal-cutlet in a volume bound in vellum. in the fourth and last of mr. lear's books, we meet not only with familiar words, but personages and places,--old friends like the jumblies, the yonghy-bonghy-bo, the quangle wangle, the hills of the chankly bore, and the great gromboolian plain, as well as new creations, such as the dong with a luminous nose, whose story is a sort of nonsense version of the love of nausicaa for ulysses, only that the sexes are inverted. in these verses, graceful fancy is so subtly interwoven with nonsense as almost to beguile us into feeling a real interest in mr. lear's absurd creations. so again in the pelican chorus there are some charming lines:--      by day we fish, and at eve we stand     on long bare islands of yellow sand.     and when the sun sinks slowly down,     and the great rock-walls grow dark and brown,     when the purple river rolls fast and dim,     and the ivory ibis starlike skim,     wing to wing we dance around, etc.  the other nonsense-poems are all good, but we have no space for further quotation, and will take leave of our subject by propounding the following set of examination questions which a friend who is deeply versed in mr. lear's books has drawn up for us:--    1. what do you gather from a study of mr. lear's works to      have been the prevalent characteristics of the inhabitants of      gretna, prague, thermopylae, wick, and hong kong?    2. state briefly what historical events are connected with      ischia, chertsey, whitehaven, boulak, and jellibolee.    3. comment, with illustrations, upon mr. lear's use of the      following words: runcible, propitious, dolomphious, borascible,      fizzgiggious, himmeltanious, tumble-dum-down, spongetaneous.    4. enumerate accurately all the animals who lived on the      quangle wangle's hat, and explain how the quangle wangle      was enabled at once to enlighten his five travelling companions      as to the true nature of the co-operative cauliflower.    5. what were the names of the five daughters of the old      person of china, and what was the purpose for which the      old man of the dargle purchased six barrels of gargle?    6. collect notices of king xerxes in mr. lear's works, and      state your theory, if you have any, as to the character and      appearance of nupiter piffkin.    7. draw pictures of the plum-pudding flea, and the moppsikon      floppsikon bear, and state by whom waterproof tubs      were first used.    8.         there was an old man at a station                who made a promiscuous oration.       what bearing may we assume the foregoing couplet to have      upon mr. lear's political views?                                    --the london spectator.                                               a book of nonsense  by  edward lear.  with all the original pictures and verses           there was an old derry down derry, who loved to see little folks   merry;     so he made them a book, and with laughter they shook       at the fun of that derry down derry.                     original dedication.                         to the  great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces            of edward, 13th earl of derby,           this book of drawings and verses       (the greater part of which were originally          made and composed for their parents.)                 is dedicated by the author,                                           edward lear.         london, 1862.                                                         there was an old man with a nose,     who said, if you choose to suppose     that my nose is too long, you are certainly wrong!     that remarkable man with a nose.            there was a young person of smyrna,     whose grandmother threatened to burn her;

        and there seems but one objection;     which is, if you'll let me speak so bold,     your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,         and would probably give me the roo-         matiz, said the kangaroo.                                       iv.      said the duck, as i sate on the rocks,         i have thought over that completely;     and i bought four pairs of worsted socks,         which fit my web-feet neatly;     and, to keep out the cold, i've bought a cloak;     and every day a cigar i'll smoke;         all to follow my own dear true         love of a kangaroo.                       v.      said the kangaroo, i'm ready,         all in the moonlight pale;     but to balance me well, dear duck, sit steady,         and quite at the end of my tail.     so away they went with a hop and a bound;     and they hopped the whole world three times round.         and who so happy, oh! who,         as the duck and the kangaroo?                    the daddy long-legs and the fly.                        i.      once mr. daddy long-legs,         dressed in brown and gray,     walked about upon the sands         upon a summer's day:     and there among the pebbles,         when the wind was rather cold,     he met with mr. floppy fly,         all dressed in blue and gold;     and, as it was too soon to dine,     they drank some periwinkle-wine,     and played an hour or two, or more,     at battlecock and shuttledore.                       ii.      said mr. daddy long-legs         to mr. floppy fly,     why do you never come to court?         i wish you 'd tell me why.     all gold and shine, in dress so fine,         you'd quite delight the court.     why do you never go at all?         i really think you ought.     and, if you went, you'd see such sights!     such rugs and jugs and candle-lights!     and, more than all, the king and queen,--     one in red, and one in green.                       iii.      o mr. daddy long-legs!         said mr. floppy fly,     it's true i never go to court;         and i will tell you why.     if i had six long legs like yours,         at once i'd go to court;     but, oh! i can't, because my legs         are so extremely short.     and i'm afraid the king and queen     (one in red, and one in green)     would say aloud, 'you are not fit,     you fly, to come to court a bit!'                       iv.      oh, mr. daddy long-legs!         said mr. floppy fly,     i wish you 'd sing one little song,         one mumbian melody.     you used to sing so awful well         in former days gone by;     but now you never sing at all:         i wish you'd tell me why:     for, if you would, the silvery sound     would please the shrimps and cockles round,     and all the crabs would gladly come     to hear you sing, 'ah, hum di hum!'                       v.      said mr. daddy long-legs,        i can never sing again;     and, if you wish, i'll tell you why,         although it gives me pain.     for years i cannot hum a bit,         or sing the smallest song;     and this the dreadful reason is,--         my legs are grown too long!     my six long legs, all here and there,     oppress my bosom with despair;     and, if i stand or lie or sit,     i cannot sing one single bit!                       vi.      so mr. daddy long-legs         and mr. floppy fly     sat down in silence by the sea,         and gazed upon the sky.     they said, this is a dreadful thing!         the world has all gone wrong,     since one has legs too short by half,         the other much too long.     one never more can go to court,     because his legs have grown too short;     the other cannot sing a song,     because his legs have grown too long!                       vii.      then mr. daddy long-legs         and mr. floppy fly     rushed downward to the foamy sea         with one sponge-taneous cry:     and there they found a little boat,         whose sails were pink and gray;     and off they sailed among the waves,         far and far away:     they sailed across the silent main,     and reached the great gromboolian plain;     and there they play forevermore     at battlecock and shuttledore.       the jumblies.                        i.      they went to sea in a sieve, they did;         in a sieve they went to sea:     in spite of all their friends could say,     on a winter's morn, on a stormy day,         in a sieve they went to sea.     and when the sieve turned round and round,     and every one cried, you'll all be drowned!     they called aloud, our sieve ain't big;     but we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:         in a sieve we'll go to sea!              far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:              their heads are green, and their hands are blue         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        ii.      they sailed away in a sieve, they did,         in a sieve they sailed so fast,     with only a beautiful pea-green veil     tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,         to a small tobacco-pipe mast.     and every one said who saw them go,    oh! won't they be soon upset, you know?     for the sky is dark, and the voyage is long;     and, happen what may, it's extremely wrong         in a sieve to sail so fast.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        iii.      the water it soon came in, it did;         the water it soon came in:     so, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet         in a pinky paper all folded neat;     and they fastened it down with a pin.     and they passed the night in a crockery-jar;     and each of them said, how wise we are!     though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,     yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,         while round in our sieve we spin.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        iv.      and all night long they sailed away;         and when the sun went down,     they whistled and warbled a moony song         to the echoing sound of a coppery gong,     in the shade of the mountains brown.    o timballoo! how happy we are     when we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!     and all night long, in the moonlight pale,     we sail away with a pea-green sail         in the shade of the mountains brown.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        v.      they sailed to the western sea, they did,--         to a land all covered with trees:     and they bought an owl, and a useful cart,         and a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,     and a hive of silvery bees;     and they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,     and a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,     and forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,         and no end of stilton cheese.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        vi.      and in twenty years they all came back,--         in twenty years or more;     and every one said, how tall they've grown!         for they've been to the lakes, and the torrible zone,     and the hills of the chankly bore.     and they drank their health, and gave them a feast     of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;     and every one said, if we only live,     we, too, will go to sea in a sieve,         to the hills of the chankly bore.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.     the nutcrackers and the sugar-tongs.                         i.      the nutcrackers sate by a plate on the table;         the sugar-tongs sate by a plate at his side;     and the nutcrackers said, don't you wish we were able         along the blue hills and green meadows to ride?     must we drag on this stupid existence forever,         so idle and weary, so full of remorse,     while every one else takes his pleasure, and never         seems happy unless he is riding a horse?                        ii.      don't you think we could ride without being instructed,         without any saddle or bridle or spur?     our legs are so long, and so aptly constructed,         i'm sure that an accident could not occur.     let us all of a sudden hop down from the table,         and hustle downstairs, and each jump on a horse!     shall we try? shall we go? do you think we are able?         the sugar-tongs answered distinctly, of course!                        iii.      so down the long staircase they hopped in a minute;         the sugar-tongs snapped, and the crackers said crack!     the stable was open; the horses were in it:         each took out a pony, and jumped on his back.     the cat in a fright scrambled out of the doorway;         the mice tumbled out of a bundle of hay;     the brown and white rats, and the black ones from norway,         screamed out, they are taking the horses away!                        iv.      the whole of the household was filled with amazement:         the cups and the saucers danced madly about;     the plates and the dishes looked out of the casement;         the salt-cellar stood on his head with a shout;     the spoons, with a clatter, looked out of the lattice;         the mustard-pot climbed up the gooseberry-pies;     the soup-ladle peeped through a heap of veal-patties,         and squeaked with a ladle-like scream of surprise.                        v.      the frying-pan said, it's an awful delusion!         the tea-kettle hissed, and grew black in the face;     and they all rushed downstairs in the wildest confusion         to see the great nutcracker-sugar-tong race.     and out of the stable, with screamings and laughter         (their ponies were cream-colored, speckled with brown),     the nutcrackers first, and the sugar-tongs after;         rode all round the yard, and then all round the town.                        vi.      they rode through the street, and they rode by the station;         they galloped away to the beautiful shore;     in silence they rode, and made no observation,         save this: we will never go back any more!     and still you might hear, till they rode out of hearing,         the sugar-tongs snap, and the crackers say crack!     till, far in the distance their forms disappearing,         they faded away; and they never came back!     calico pie.                         i.        calico pie,       the little birds fly     down to the calico-tree:       their wings were blue,       and they sang tilly-loo!       till away they flew;         and they never came back to me!           they never came back,           they never came back,         they never came back to me!                        ii.        calico jam,       the little fish swam     over the syllabub sea.       he took off his hat       to the sole and the sprat,       and the willeby-wat:         but he never came back to me;           he never came back,           he never came back,         he never came back to me.                                         iii.        calico ban,       the little mice ran     to be ready in time for tea;       flippity flup,       they drank it all up,       and danced in the cup:         but they never came back to me;           they never came back,           they never came back,         they never came back to me.                                         iv.        calico drum,       the grasshoppers come,     the butterfly, beetle, and bee,       over the ground,       around and round,       with a hop and a bound;         but they never came back,           they never came back,           they never came back.         they never came back to me.                      mr. and mrs. spikky sparrow.                         i.      on a little piece of wood     mr. spikky sparrow stood:     mrs. sparrow sate close by,     a-making of an insect-pie     for her little children five,     in the nest and all alive;     singing with a cheerful smile,     to amuse them all the while,        twikky wikky wikky wee,         wikky bikky twikky tee,             spikky bikky bee!                        ii.      mrs. spikky sparrow said,     spikky, darling! in my head     many thoughts of trouble come,     like to flies upon a plum.     all last night, among the trees,     i heard you cough, i heard you sneeze;     and thought i, 'it's come to that     because he does not wear a hat!'         chippy wippy sikky tee,         bikky wikky tikky mee,             spikky chippy wee!                        iii.      not that you are growing old;     but the nights are growing cold.     no one stays out all night long     without a hat: i'm sure it's wrong!     mr. spikky said, how kind,     dear, you are, to speak your mind!     all your life i wish you luck!     you are, you are, a lovely duck!         witchy witchy witchy wee,         twitchy witchy witchy bee,             tikky tikky tee!                        iv.      i was also sad, and thinking,     when one day i saw you winking,     and i heard you sniffle-snuffle,     and i saw your feathers ruffle:     to myself i sadly said,     'she's neuralgia in her head!     that dear head has nothing on it!     ought she not to wear a bonnet?'         witchy kitchy kitchy wee,         spikky wikky mikky bee,             chippy wippy chee!                        v.      let us both fly up to town:     there i'll buy you such a gown!     which, completely in the fashion,     you shall tie a sky-blue sash on;     and a pair of slippers neat     to fit your darling little feet,     so that you will look and feel     quite galloobious and genteel.         jikky wikky bikky see,         chicky bikky wikky bee,             twicky witchy wee!                        vi.      so they both to london went,     alighting on the monument;     whence they flew down swiftly--pop!     into moses' wholesale shop:     there they bought a hat and bonnet,     and a gown with spots upon it,     a satin sash of cloxam blue,     and a pair of slippers too.         zikky wikky mikky bee,         witchy witchy mitchy kee,             sikky tikky wee!                        vii.      then, when so completely dressed,     back they flew, and reached their nest.     their children cried, o ma and pa!     how truly beautiful you are!     said they, we trust that cold or pain     we shall never feel again;     while, perched on tree or house or steeple,     we now shall look like other people.         witchy witchy witchy wee,         twikky mikky bikky bee,             zikky sikky tee!                      the broom, the shovel, the poker, and the tongs.                         i.      the broom and the shovel, the poker and tongs,       they all took a drive in the park;     and they each sang a song, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!       before they went back in the dark.     mr. poker he sate quite upright in the coach;       mr. tongs made a clatter and clash;     miss shovel was dressed all in black (with a brooch);       mrs. broom was in blue (with a sash).         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         and they all sang a song.                        ii.     o shovely so lovely! the poker he sang,      you have perfectly conquered my heart.     ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong! if you're pleased with my song,       i will feed you with cold apple-tart.     when you scrape up the coals with a delicate sound,       you enrapture my life with delight,     your nose is so shiny, your head is so round,       and your shape is so slender and bright!         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         ain't you pleased with my song?                        iii.     alas! mrs. broom, sighed the tongs in his song,      oh! is it because i'm so thin,     and my legs are so long,--ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!--       that you don't care about me a pin?     ah! fairest of creatures, when sweeping the room,       ah! why don't you heed my complaint?     must you needs be so cruel, you beautiful broom,       because you are covered with paint?         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         you are certainly wrong.                        iv.      mrs. broom and miss shovel together they sang,      what nonsense you're singing to-day!     said the shovel, i'll certainly hit you a bang!       said the broom, and i'll sweep you away!     so the coachman drove homeward as fast as he could,       perceiving their anger with pain;     but they put on the kettle, and little by little       they all became happy again.         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         there's an end of my song.     the table and the chair.                         i.      said the table to the chair,     you can hardly be aware     how i suffer from the heat     and from chilblains on my feet.     if we took a little walk,     we might have a little talk;     pray let us take the air,     said the table to the chair.                        ii.      said the chair unto the table,     now, you know we are not able:     how foolishly you talk,     when you know we cannot walk!     said the table with a sigh,     it can do no harm to try.     i've as many legs as you:     why can't we walk on two?                        iii.      so they both went slowly down,     and walked about the town     with a cheerful bumpy sound     as they toddled round and round;     and everybody cried,     as they hastened to their side,     see! the table and the chair     have come out to take the air!                        iv.      but in going down an alley,     to a castle in a valley,     they completely lost their way,     and wandered all the day;     till, to see them safely back,     they paid a ducky-quack,     and a beetle, and a mouse,     who took them to their house.                                        v.      then they whispered to each other,     o delightful little brother,     what a lovely walk we've taken!     let us dine on beans and bacon.     so the ducky and the leetle     browny-mousy and the beetle     dined, and danced upon their heads     till they toddled to their beds.                                                              nonsense stories.   the story of the four little children who went round the world.  once upon a time, a long while ago, there were four little people whose names were    violet, slingsby, guy, and lionel; and they all thought they should like to see the world. so they bought a large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, and then they were to come back on the other side by land. the boat was painted blue with green spots, and the sail was yellow with red stripes: and, when they set off, they only took a small cat to steer and look after the boat, besides an elderly quangle-wangle, who had to cook the dinner and make the tea; for which purposes they took a large kettle.    for the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and found plenty to eat, as there were lots of fish; and they had only to take them out of the sea with a long spoon, when the quangle-wangle instantly cooked them; and the pussy-cat was fed with the bones, with which she expressed herself pleased, on the whole: so that all the party were very happy.  during the daytime, violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt water into a churn; while her three brothers churned it violently, in the hope that it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did; and in the evening they all retired into the tea-kettle, where they all managed to sleep very comfortably, while pussy and the quangle-wangle managed the boat.    after a time, they saw some land at a distance; and, when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses, with a great gulf-stream running about all over it; so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.  when they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their great surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and chocolate-drops, and nothing else. so they all climbed up the single high tree to discover, if possible, if there were any people; but having remained on the top of the tree for a week, and not seeing anybody, they naturally concluded that there were no inhabitants; and accordingly, when they came down, they loaded the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets and a million of chocolate-drops; and these afforded them sustenance for more than a month, during which time they pursued their voyage with the utmost delight and apathy.    after this they came to a shore where there were no less than sixty-five great red parrots with blue tails, sitting on a rail all of a row, and all fast asleep. and i am sorry to say that the pussy-cat and the quangle-wangle crept softly, and bit off the tail-feathers of all the sixty-five parrots; for which violet reproved them both severely.    notwithstanding which, she proceeded to insert all the feathers--two hundred and sixty in number--in her bonnet; thereby causing it to have a lovely and glittering appearance, highly prepossessing and efficacious.    the next thing that happened to them was in a narrow part of the sea, which was so entirely full of fishes that the boat could go on no farther: so they remained there about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly all the fishes, which were soles, and all ready-cooked, and covered with shrimp-sauce, so that there was no trouble whatever. and as the few fishes who remained uneaten complained of the cold, as well as of the difficulty they had in getting any sleep on account of the extreme noise made by the arctic bears and the tropical turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood in great numbers, violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for several of the fishes, and slingsby administered some opium-drops to them; through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.    then they came to a country which was wholly covered with immense orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of fruit. so they all landed, taking with them the tea-kettle, intending to gather some of the oranges, and place them in it. but, while they were busy about this, a most dreadfully high wind rose, and blew out most of the parrot-tail feathers from violet's bonnet. that, however, was nothing compared with the calamity of the oranges falling down on their heads by millions and millions, which thumped and bumped and bumped and thumped them all so seriously, that they were obliged to run as hard as they could for their lives; besides that the sound of the oranges rattling on the tea-kettle was of the most fearful and amazing nature.    nevertheless, they got safely to the boat, although considerably vexed and hurt; and the quangle-wangle's right foot was so knocked about, that he had to sit with his head in his slipper for at least a week.    this event made them all for a time rather melancholy: and perhaps they might never have become less so, had not lionel, with a most praiseworthy devotion and perseverance, continued to stand on one leg, and whistle to them in a loud and lively manner; which diverted the whole party so extremely that they gradually recovered their spirits, and agreed that whenever they should reach home, they would subscribe towards a testimonial to lionel, entirely made of gingerbread and raspberries, as an earnest token of their sincere and grateful infection.    after sailing on calmly for several more days, they came to another country, where they were much pleased and surprised to see a countless multitude of white mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle, slowly eating custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite demeanor.    and as the four travellers were rather hungry, being tired of eating nothing but soles and oranges for so long a period, they held a council as to the propriety of asking the mice for some of their pudding in a humble and affecting manner, by which they could hardly be otherwise than gratified. it was agreed, therefore, that guy should go and ask the mice, which he immediately did; and the result was, that they gave a walnut-shell only half full of custard diluted with water. now, this displeased guy, who said, out of such a lot of pudding as you have got, i must say, you might have spared a somewhat larger quantity. but no sooner had he finished speaking than the mice turned round at once, and sneezed at him in an appalling and vindictive manner (and it is impossible to imagine a more scroobious and unpleasant sound than that caused by the simultaneous sneezing of many millions of angry mice); so that guy rushed back to the boat, having first shied his cap into the middle of the custard-pudding, by which means he completely spoiled the mice's dinner.    by and by the four children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. each of these blue bottles contained a blue-bottle-fly; and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony: nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. violet and slingsby and guy and lionel were greatly struck with this singular and instructive settlement; and, having previously asked permission of the blue-bottle-flies (which was most courteously granted), the boat was drawn up to the shore, and they proceeded to make tea in front of the bottles: but as they had no tea-leaves, they merely placed some pebbles in the hot water; and the quangle-wangle played some tunes over it on an accordion, by which, of course, tea was made directly, and of the very best quality.  the four children then entered into conversation with the blue-bottle-flies, who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they each held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally occasioned a fizzy, extraneous utterance.  why, said violet, would you kindly inform us, do you reside in bottles; and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple, or, indeed, in yellow bottles?  to which questions a very aged blue-bottle-fly answered, we found the bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our great-great-great- great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at once. and, when the winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside down, and consequently rarely feel the cold at all; and you know very well that this could not be the case with bottles of any other color than blue.  of course it could not, said slingsby. but, if we may take the liberty of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?  mainly on oyster-patties, said the blue-bottle-fly; and, when these are scarce, on raspberry vinegar and russian leather boiled down to a jelly.  how delicious! said guy.  to which lionel added, huzz! and all the blue-bottle-flies said, buzz!  at this time, an elderly fly said it was the hour for the evening-song to be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the blue-bottle-flies began to buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner, the melodious and mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters, and resounding across the tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice upon the intervening and verdant mountains with a serene and sickly suavity only known to the truly virtuous. the moon was shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky, while her light irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of the blue-bottle-flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous circumstances.  in many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to that evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was already past midnight when--the sail of the boat having been set up by the quangle-wangle, the tea-kettle and churn placed in their respective positions, and the pussy-cat stationed at the helm--the children each took a last and affectionate farewell of the blue-bottle-flies, who walked down in a body to the water's edge to see the travellers embark.    as a token of parting respect and esteem, violet made a courtesy quite down to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining parrot-tail feathers into the back hair of the most pleasing of the blue-bottle-flies; while slingsby, guy, and lionel offered them three small boxes, containing, respectively, black pins, dried figs, and epsom salts; and thus they left that happy shore forever.  overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly jumped into the tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. but all along the shore, for many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of severely-suppressed sobs, and of a vague multitude of living creatures using their pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous snuffle, lingering sadly along the walloping waves as the boat sailed farther and farther away from the land of the happy blue-bottle-flies.  nothing particular occurred for some days after these events, except that, as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they perceived an unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large number of crabs and crawfish--perhaps six or seven hundred--sitting by the water-side, and endeavoring to disentangle a vast heap of pale pink worsted, which they moistened at intervals with a fluid composed of lavender-water and white-wine negus.  can we be of any service to you, o crusty crabbies? said the four children.  thank you kindly, said the crabs consecutively. we are trying to make some worsted mittens, but do not know how.  on which violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of mitten-making, said to the crabs, do your claws unscrew, or are they fixtures?  they are all made to unscrew, said the crabs; and forthwith they deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which violet uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest mittens with it you can imagine. these the crabs, having resumed and screwed on their claws, placed cheerfully upon their wrists, and walked away rapidly on their hind-legs, warbling songs with a silvery voice and in a minor key.  after this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to a vast and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing whatever could be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked onward, there appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single object, which on a nearer approach, and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig, sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cakes and oyster-shells. it does not quite look like a human being, said violet doubtfully; nor could they make out what it really was, till the quangle-wangle (who had previously been round the world) exclaimed softly in a loud voice, it is the co-operative cauliflower!    and so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the cauliflower; and that he had no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk,--an accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense of stockings and shoes.  presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and, in a somewhat plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the setting sun,--his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers, and a large number of waterwagtails proceeding in advance of him by three and three in a row,--till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand.    so remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.  shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below some high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly odious little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers, and with a pewter plate upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin at the boat, by which it was instantly upset.    but this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party knew how to swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming about till after the moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they sponge-taneously entered the boat. meanwhile the quangle-wangle threw back the pumpkin with immense force, so that it hit the rocks where the malicious little boy in rose-colored knickerbockers was sitting; when, being quite full of lucifer-matches, the pumpkin exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits; whereon the rocks instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became unpleasantly hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were turned quite green, and his nose was burnt off.  two or three days after this had happened, they came to another place, where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep pits full of mulberry-jam. this is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed apes who abound in these districts, and who store up the mulberry-jam for their food in winter, when they mix it with pellucid pale periwinkle-soup, and serve it out in wedgewood china-bowls, which grow freely all over that part of the country. only one of the yellow-nosed apes was on the spot, and he was fast asleep; yet the four travellers and the quangle-wangle and pussy were so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring, that they merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned to re-embark in their boat without delay.  what was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn and the tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous seeze pyder, an aquatic and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and, happily, only met with in those excessive longitudes! in a moment, the beautiful boat was bitten into fifty-five thousand million hundred billion bits; and it instantly became quite clear that violet, slingsby, guy, and lionel could no longer preliminate their voyage by sea.  the four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing their wanderings by land: and, very fortunately, there happened to pass by at that moment an elderly rhinoceros, on which they seized; and, all four mounting on his back,--the quangle-wangle sitting on his horn, and holding on by his ears, and the pussy-cat swinging at the end of his tail,--they set off, having only four small beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes to last through their whole journey.    they were, however, able to catch numbers of the chickens and turkeys and other birds who incessantly alighted on the head of the rhinoceros for the purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew there; and these creatures they cooked in the most translucent and satisfactory manner by means of a fire lighted on the end of the rhinoceros's back. a crowd of kangaroos and gigantic cranes accompanied them, from feelings of curiosity and complacency; so that they were never at a loss for company, and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse and triumphant procession.  thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at home, where they were received by their admiring relatives with joy tempered with contempt, and where they finally resolved to carry out the rest of their travelling-plans at some more favorable opportunity.  as for the rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they had him killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside the door of their father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper.       the history of the seven families of the lake pipple-popple.   chapter i.  introductory.  in former days,--that is to say, once upon a time,--there lived in the land of gramble-blamble seven families. they lived by the side of the great lake pipple-popple (one of the seven families, indeed, lived in the lake), and on the outskirts of the city of tosh, which, excepting when it was quite dark, they could see plainly. the names of all these places you have probably heard of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to find out all about them.  now, the seven families who lived on the borders of the great lake pipple-popple were as follows in the next chapter.   chapter ii.  the seven families.  there was a family of two old parrots and seven young parrots.    there was a family of two old storks and seven young storks.    there was a family of two old geese and seven young geese.    there was a family of two old owls and seven young owls.    there was a family of two old guinea pigs and seven young guinea pigs.    there was a family of two old cats and seven young cats.    and there was a family of two old fishes and seven young fishes.     chapter iii.  the habits of the seven families.  the parrots lived upon the soffsky-poffsky trees, which were beautiful to behold, and covered with blue leaves; and they fed upon fruit, artichokes, and striped beetles.  the storks walked in and out of the lake pipple-popple, and ate frogs for breakfast, and buttered toast for tea; but on account of the extreme length of their legs they could not sit down, and so they walked about continually.  the geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies, which they ate for dinner.  the owls anxiously looked after mice, which they caught, and made into sago-puddings.  the guinea pigs toddled about the gardens, and ate lettuces and cheshire cheese.  the cats sate still in the sunshine, and fed upon sponge biscuits.  the fishes lived in the lake, and fed chiefly on boiled periwinkles.  and all these seven families lived together in the utmost fun and felicity.   chapter iv.  the children of the seven families are sent away.  one day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the seven families agreed that they would send their children out to see the world.  so they called them all together, and gave them each eight shillings and some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small green morocco pocket-book to set down their expenses in.  they then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all the parents sent off their children with a parting injunction.  if, said the old parrots, you find a cherry, do not fight about who should have it.  and, said the old storks, if you find a frog, divide it carefully into seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it.  and the old geese said to the seven young geese, whatever you do, be sure you do not touch a plum-pudding flea.  and the old owls said, if you find a mouse, tear him up into seven slices, and eat him cheerfully, but without quarrelling.  and the old guinea pigs said, have a care that you eat your lettuces, should you find any, not greedily, but calmly.  and the old cats said, be particularly careful not to meddle with a clangle-wangle if you should see one.  and the old fishes said, above all things, avoid eating a blue boss-woss; for they do not agree with fishes, and give them a pain in their toes.  so all the children of each family thanked their parents; and, making in all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide world.    chapter v.  the history of the seven young parrots.  the seven young parrots had not gone far, when they saw a tree with a single cherry on it, which the oldest parrot picked instantly; but the other six, being extremely hungry, tried to get it also. on which all the seven began to fight; and they scuffled,      and huffled,        and ruffled,          and shuffled,            and puffled,              and muffled,                and buffled,                  and duffled,                    and fluffled,                      and guffled,                        and bruffled,                          and screamed, and shrieked, and squealed, and squeaked, and clawed, and snapped, and bit, and bumped, and thumped, and dumped, and flumped each other, till they were all torn into little bits; and at last there was nothing left to record this painful incident except the cherry and seven small green feathers.  and that was the vicious and voluble end of the seven young parrots.     chapter vi.  the history of the seven young storks.  when the seven young storks set out, they walked or flew for fourteen weeks in a straight line, and for six weeks more in a crooked one; and after that they ran as hard as they could for one hundred and eight miles; and after that they stood still, and made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery noise with their bills.  about the same time they perceived a large frog, spotted with green, and with a sky-blue stripe under each ear.  so, being hungry, they immediately flew at him, and were going to divide him into seven pieces, when they began to quarrel as to which of his legs should be taken off first. one said this, and another said that; and while they were all quarrelling, the frog hopped away. and when they saw that he was gone, they began to   chatter-clatter,       blatter-platter,           patter-blatter,               matter-clatter,                   flatter-quatter, more violently than ever; and after they had fought for a week, they pecked each other all to little pieces, so that at last nothing was left of any of them except their bills.  and that was the end of the seven young storks.     chapter vii.  the history of the seven young geese.  when the seven young geese began to travel, they went over a large plain, on which there was but one tree, and that was, a very bad one.  so four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about them; while the other three waddled up and down, and repeated poetry, and their last six lessons in arithmetic, geography, and cookery.  presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most interesting and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body exactly resembling a boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and a beak, and three feathers growing out of his head, and only one leg.  so, after a time, all the seven young geese said to each other, beyond all doubt this beast must be a plum-pudding flea!  on which they incautiously began to sing aloud,         plum-pudding flea,         plum-pudding flea,         wherever you be,         oh! come to our tree,     and listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!  and no sooner had they sung this verse than the plum-pudding flea began to hop and skip on his one leg with the most dreadful velocity, and came straight to the tree, where he stopped, and looked about him in a vacant and voluminous manner.  on which the seven young geese were greatly alarmed, and all of a tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and just touched him with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he done this than the plum-pudding flea skipped and hopped about more and more, and higher and higher; after which he opened his mouth, and, to the great surprise and indignation of the seven geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and terribly, that they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees every one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.  so that was the end of the seven young geese.     chapter viii.  the history of the seven young owls.  when the seven young owls set out, they sate every now and then on the branches of old trees, and never went far at one time.  and one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard a mouse; but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not see him.  so they called out, is that a mouse?  on which a mouse answered, squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!  and immediately all the young owls threw themselves off the tree, meaning to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive that there was a large well below them, into which they all fell superficially, and were every one of them drowned in less than half a minute.  so that was the end of the seven young owls.     chapter ix.  the history of the seven young guinea pigs.  the seven young guinea pigs went into a garden full of goose-berry-bushes and tiggory-trees, under one of which they fell asleep. when they awoke, they saw a large lettuce, which had grown out of the ground while they had been sleeping, and which had an immense number of green leaves. at which they all exclaimed,--     lettuce! o lettuce     let us, o let us,     o lettuce-leaves,     o let us leave this tree, and eat     lettuce, o let us, lettuce-leaves!  and instantly the seven young guinea pigs rushed with such extreme force against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly against its stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient transitional inflammation of their noses, which grew worse and worse and worse and worse, till it incidentally killed them all seven.  and that was the end of the seven young guinea pigs.     chapter x.  the history of the seven young cats.  the seven young cats set off on their travels with great delight and rapacity. but, on coming to the top of a high hill, they perceived at a long distance off a clangle-wangle (or, as it is more properly written, clangel-wangel); and, in spite of the warning they had had, they ran straight up to it.  (now, the clangle-wangle is a most dangerous and delusive beast, and by no means commonly to be met with. they live in the water as well as on land, using their long tail as a sail when in the former element. their speed is extreme; but their habits of life are domestic and superfluous, and their general demeanor pensive and pellucid. on summer evenings, they may sometimes be observed near the lake pipple-popple, standing on their heads, and humming their national melodies. they subsist entirely on vegetables, excepting when they eat veal or mutton or pork or beef or fish or saltpetre.)  the moment the clangle-wangle saw the seven young cats approach, he ran away; and as he ran straight on for four months, and the cats, though they continued to run, could never overtake him, they all gradually died of fatigue and exhaustion, and never afterwards recovered.  and this was the end of the seven young cats.     chapter xi.  the history of the seven young fishes.  the seven young fishes swam across the lake pipple-popple, and into the river, and into the ocean; where, most unhappily for them, they saw, on the fifteenth day of their travels, a bright-blue boss-woss, and instantly swam after him. but the blue boss-woss plunged into a     perpendicular,         spicular,             orbicular,                 quadrangular,                      circular depth of soft mud; where, in fact, his house was.  and the seven young fishes, swimming with great and uncomfortable velocity, plunged also into the mud quite against their will, and, not being accustomed to it, were all suffocated in a very short period.  and that was the end of the seven young fishes.     chapter xii.  of what occurred subsequently.  after it was known that the              seven young parrots,     and the seven young storks,     and the seven young geese,     and the seven young owls,     and the seven young guinea pigs,     and the seven young cats,     and the seven young fishes,  were all dead, then the frog, and the plum-pudding flea, and the mouse, and the clangle-wangle, and the blue boss-woss, all met together to rejoice over their good fortune. and they collected the seven feathers of the seven young parrots, and the seven bills of the seven young storks, and the lettuce, and the cherry; and having placed the latter on the lettuce, and the other objects in a circular arrangement at their base, they danced a hornpipe round all these memorials until they were quite tired; after which they gave a tea-party, and a garden-party, and a ball, and a concert, and then returned to their respective homes full of joy and respect, sympathy, satisfaction, and disgust.     chapter xiii.  of what became of the parents of the forty-nine children.  but when the two old parrots,      and the two old storks,      and the two old geese,      and the two old owls,      and the two old guinea pigs,      and the two old cats,      and the two old fishes,  became aware, by reading in the newspapers, of the calamitous extinction of the whole of their families, they refused all further sustenance; and, sending out to various shops, they purchased great quantities of cayenne pepper and brandy and vinegar and blue sealing-wax, besides seven immense glass bottles with air-tight stoppers. and, having done this, they ate a light supper of brown-bread and jerusalem artichokes, and took an affecting and formal leave of the whole of their acquaintance, which was very numerous and distinguished and select and responsible and ridiculous.   chapter xiv.  conclusion.  and after this they filled the bottles with the ingredients for pickling, and each couple jumped into a separate bottle; by which effort, of course, they all died immediately, and became thoroughly pickled in a few minutes; having previously made their wills (by the assistance of the most eminent lawyers of the district), in which they left strict orders that the stoppers of the seven bottles should be carefully sealed up with the blue sealing-wax they had purchased; and that they themselves, in the bottles, should be presented to the principal museum of the city of tosh, to be labelled with parchment or any other anti-congenial succedaneum, and to be placed on a marble table with silver-gilt legs, for the daily inspection and contemplation, and for the perpetual benefit, of the pusillanimous public.  and if you ever happen to go to gramble-blamble, and visit that museum in the city of tosh, look for them on the ninety-eighth table in the four hundred and twenty-seventh room of the right-hand corridor of the left wing of the central quadrangle of that magnificent building; for, if you do not, you certainly will not see them.                                                                 nonsense cookery.  extract from the nonsense gazette, for august, 1870.  our readers will be interested in the following communications from our valued and learned contributor, prof. bosh, whose labors in the fields of culinary and botanical science are so well known to all the world. the first three articles richly merit to be added to the domestic cookery of every family: those which follow claim the attention of all botanists; and we are happy to be able, through dr. bosh's kindness, to present our readers with illustrations of his discoveries. all the new flowers are found in the valley of verrikwier, near the lake of oddgrow, and on the summit of the hill orfeltugg.    three receipts for domestic cookery.   to make an amblongus pie.  take 4 pounds (say 4-1/2 pounds) of fresh amblongusses, and put them in a small pipkin.  cover them with water, and boil them for 8 hours incessantly; after which add 2 pints of new milk, and proceed to boil for 4 hours more.  when you have ascertained that the amblongusses are quite soft, take them out, and place them in a wide pan, taking care to shake them well previously.  grate some nutmeg over the surface, and cover them carefully with powdered gingerbread, curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity of cayenne pepper.  remove the pan into the next room, and place it on the floor. bring it back again, and let it simmer for three-quarters of an hour. shake the pan violently till all the amblongusses have become of a pale purple color.  then, having prepared the paste, insert the whole carefully; adding at the same time a small pigeon, 2 slices of beef, 4 cauliflowers, and any number of oysters.  watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of salt from time to time.  serve up in a clean dish, and throw the whole out of window as fast as possible.   to make crumbobblious cutlets.  procure some strips of beef, and, having cut them into the smallest possible slices, proceed to cut them still smaller,--eight, or perhaps nine times.  when the whole is thus minced, brush it up hastily with a new clothes-brush, and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon or a soup-ladle.  place the whole in a saucepan, and remove it to a sunny place,--say the roof of the house, if free from sparrows or other birds,--and leave it there for about a week.  at the end of that time add a little lavender, some oil of almonds, and a few herring-bones; and then cover the whole with 4 gallons of clarified crumbobblious sauce, when it will be ready for use.  cut it into the shape of ordinary cutlets, and serve up in a clean table-cloth or dinner-napkin.   to make gosky patties.  take a pig three or four years of age, and tie him by the off hind-leg to a post. place 5 pounds of currants, 3 of sugar, 2 pecks of peas, 18 roast chestnuts, a candle, and 6 bushels of turnips, within his reach: if he eats these, constantly provide him with more.  then procure some cream, some slices of cheshire cheese, 4 quires of foolscap paper, and a packet of black pins. work the whole into a paste, and spread it out to dry on a sheet of clean brown waterproof linen.  when the paste is perfectly dry, but not before, proceed to beat the pig violently with the handle of a large broom. if he squeals, beat him again.  visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days, and ascertain if, at the end of that period, the whole is about to turn into gosky patties.  if it does not then, it never will; and in that case the pig may be let loose, and the whole process may be considered as finished.                                              nonsense botany.

 (the ladies looked puzzled, as indeed was i, the author.)  do you not know who is the writer of it? asked the gentleman.  the name is 'edward lear,' said one of the ladies.  ah! said the first speaker, so it is printed; but that is only a whim of the real author, the earl of derby. 'edward' is his christian name, and, as you may see, lear is only earl transposed.  but, said the lady, doubtingly, here is a dedication to the great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces of edward, thirteenth earl of derby, by the author, edward lear.  that, replied the other, is simply a piece of mystification; i am in a position to know that the whole book was composed and illustrated by lord derby himself. in fact, there is no such a person at all as edward lear.  yet, said the other lady, some friends of mine tell me they know mr. lear.  quite a mistake! completely a mistake! said the old gentleman, becoming rather angry at the contradiction; i am well aware of what i am saying: i can inform you, no such a person as 'edward lear' exists!  hitherto i had kept silence; but as my hat was, as well as my handkerchief and stick, largely marked inside with my name, and as i happened to have in my pocket several letters addressed to me, the temptation was too great to resist; so, flashing all these articles at once on my would-be extinguisher's attention, i speedily reduced him to silence.  the second volume of nonsense, commencing with the verses, the owl and the pussy-cat, was written at different times, and for different sets of children: the whole being collected in the course of last year, were then illustrated, and published in a single volume, by mr. r.j. bush, of 32 charing cross.  the contents of the third or present volume were made also at different intervals in the last two years.  long years ago, in days when much of my time was passed in a country house, where children and mirth abounded, the lines beginning, there was an old man of tobago, were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse lending itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures; and thenceforth the greater part of the original drawings and verses for the first book of nonsense were struck off with a pen, no assistance ever having been given me in any way but that of uproarious delight and welcome at the appearance of every new absurdity.  most of these drawings and rhymes were transferred to lithographic stones in the year 1846, and were then first published by mr. thomas mclean, of the haymarket. but that edition having been soon exhausted, and the call for the book of nonsense continuing, i added a considerable number of subjects to those previously-published, and having caused the whole to be carefully reproduced in woodcuts by messrs. dalzell, i disposed of the copyright to messrs. routledge and warne, by whom the volume was published in 1843.                                                               edward lear.  villa emily, san remo, august, 1871.                                              nonsense botany.

the dong!       the wandering dong through the forest goes!         the dong! the dong!       the dong with a luminous nose!          long years ago       the dong was happy and gay,     till he fell in love with a jumbly girl       who came to those shores one day.     for the jumblies came in a sieve, they did,--     landing at eve near the zemmery fidd         where the oblong oysters grow,       and the rocks are smooth and gray.     and all the woods and the valleys rang     with the chorus they daily and nightly sang,--         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live;           their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.      happily, happily passed those days!       while the cheerful jumblies staid;         they danced in circlets all night long,         to the plaintive pipe of the lively dong,       in moonlight, shine, or shade.     for day and night he was always there     by the side of the jumbly girl so fair,     with her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;     till the morning came of that hateful day     when the jumblies sailed in their sieve away,     and the dong was left on the cruel shore     gazing, gazing for evermore,--     ever keeping his weary eyes on     that pea-green sail on the far horizon,--     singing the jumbly chorus still     as he sate all day on the grassy hill,--         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live;           their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.      but when the sun was low in the west,         the dong arose and said,--     what little sense i once possessed         has quite gone out of my head!     and since that day he wanders still     by lake and forest, marsh and hill,     singing, o somewhere, in valley or plain,     might i find my jumbly girl again!     for ever i'll seek by lake and shore     till i find my jumbly girl once more!          playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,         since then his jumbly girl he seeks;         and because by night he could not see,         he gathered the bark of the twangum tree           on the flowery plain that grows.           and he wove him a wondrous nose,--         a nose as strange as a nose could be!      of vast proportions and painted red,     and tied with cords to the back of his head.         in a hollow rounded space it ended         with a luminous lamp within suspended,             all fenced about             with a bandage stout             to prevent the wind from blowing it out;         and with holes all round to send the light         in gleaming rays on the dismal night      and now each night, and all night long,     over those plains still roams the dong;     and above the wail of the chimp and snipe     you may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,     while ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,     to meet with his jumbly girl again;     lonely and wild, all night he goes,--     the dong with a luminous nose!     and all who watch at the midnight hour,     from hall or terrace or lofty tower,     cry, as they trace the meteor bright,     moving along through the dreary night,--        this is the hour when forth he goes,         the dong with a luminous nose!         yonder, over the plain he goes,--             he goes!             he goes,--         the dong with a luminous nose!     the two old bachelors.    two old bachelors were living in one house; one caught a muffin, the other caught a mouse. said he who caught the muffin to him who caught the mouse,-- this happens just in time! for we've nothing in the house, save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey, and what to do for dinner--since we haven't any money? and what can we expect if we haven't any dinner, but to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?  said he who caught the mouse to him who caught the muffin,-- we might cook this little mouse, if we only had some stuffin'! if we had but sage and onion we could do extremely well; but how to get that stuffin' it is difficult to tell!  those two old bachelors ran quickly to the town and asked for sage and onion as they wandered up and down; they borrowed two large onions, but no sage was to be found in the shops, or in the market, or in all the gardens round.  but some one said, a hill there is, a little to the north, and to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth; and there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient sage,-- an earnest man, who reads all day a most perplexing page. climb up, and seize him by the toes,--all studious as he sits,-- and pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits! then mix him with your onion (cut up likewise into scraps),-- when your stuffin' will be ready, and very good--perhaps.  those two old bachelors without loss of time the nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb; and at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook, they saw that sage a-reading of a most enormous book.  you earnest sage! aloud they cried, your book you've read enough in! we wish to chop you into bits to mix you into stuffin'!  but that old sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book, at those two bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took; and over crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,-- at once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town; and when they reached their house, they found (besides their want                                                           of stuffin'), the mouse had fled--and, previously, had eaten up the muffin.  they left their home in silence by the once convivial door; and from that hour those bachelors were never heard of more.   [illustration: sheet music--the pelicans]      the pelican chorus.      king and queen of the pelicans we;      no other birds so grand we see!     none but we have feet like fins!     with lovely leathery throats and chins!         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still      we live on the nile. the nile we love.     by night we sleep on the cliffs above;     by day we fish, and at eve we stand     on long bare islands of yellow sand.     and when the sun sinks slowly down,     and the great rock walls grow dark and brown,      where the purple river rolls fast and dim     and the ivory ibis starlike skim,     wing to wing we dance around,     stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,     opening our mouths as pelicans ought;     and this is the song we nightly snort,--         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      last year came out our daughter dell,     and all the birds received her well.     to do her honor a feast we made     for every bird that can swim or wade,--     herons and gulls, and cormorants black,     cranes, and flamingoes with scarlet back,     plovers and storks, and geese in clouds,     swans and dilberry ducks in crowds:     thousands of birds in wondrous flight!     they ate and drank and danced all night,     and echoing back from the rocks you heard     multitude-echoes from bird and bird,--         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      yes, they came; and among the rest     the king of the cranes all grandly dressed.     such a lovely tail! its feathers float     between the ends of his blue dress-coat;     with pea-green trowsers all so neat,     and a delicate frill to hide his feet     (for though no one speaks of it, every one knows     he has got no webs between his toes).      as soon as he saw our daughter dell,     in violent love that crane king fell,--     on seeing her waddling form so fair,     with a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.     and before the end of the next long day     our dell had given her heart away;     for the king of the cranes had won that heart     with a crocodile's egg and a large fish-tart.     she vowed to marry the king of the cranes,     leaving the nile for stranger plains;     and away they flew in a gathering crowd     of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      and far away in the twilight sky     we heard them singing a lessening cry,--     farther and farther, till out of sight,     and we stood alone in the silent night!     often since, in the nights of june,     we sit on the sand and watch the moon,--      she has gone to the great gromboolian plain,     and we probably never shall meet again!     oft, in the long still nights of june,     we sit on the rocks and watch the moon,--     she dwells by the streams of the chankly bore.     and we probably never shall see her more.         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!

    and his aunt jobiska made him drink     lavender water tinged with pink;     for she said, the world in general knows     there's nothing so good for a pobble's toes!                       ii.      the pobble who has no toes,         swam across the bristol channel;     but before he set out he wrapped his nose         in a piece of scarlet flannel.     for his aunt jobiska said, no harm     can come to his toes if his nose is warm;     and it's perfectly known that a pobble's toes     are safe--provided he minds his nose.                       iii.      the pobble swam fast and well,         and when boats or ships came near him,     he tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell         so that all the world could hear him.     and all the sailors and admirals cried,     when they saw him nearing the further side,--    he has gone to fish, for his aunt jobiska's     runcible cat with crimson whiskers!                       iv.      but before he touched the shore,--         the shore of the bristol channel,     a sea-green porpoise carried away         his wrapper of scarlet flannel.     and when he came to observe his feet,     formerly garnished with toes so neat,     his face at once became forlorn     on perceiving that all his toes were gone!                       v.      and nobody ever knew,         from that dark day to the present,     whoso had taken the pobble's toes,         in a manner so far from pleasant.     whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,     or crafty mermaids stole them away,     nobody knew; and nobody knows     how the pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!                       vi.      the pobble who has no toes         was placed in a friendly bark,     and they rowed him back, and carried him up         to his aunt jobiska's park.     and she made him a feast, at his earnest wish,     of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;     and she said, it's a fact the whole world knows,     that pobbles are happier without their toes.     the new vestments.      there lived an old man in the kingdom of tess,     who invented a purely original dress;     and when it was perfectly made and complete,     he opened the door and walked into the street.      by way of a hat he'd a loaf of brown bread,     in the middle of which he inserted his head;     his shirt was made up of no end of dead mice,     the warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;     his drawers were of rabbit-skins, so were his shoes;     his stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;     his waistcoat and trowsers were made of pork chops;     his buttons were jujubes and chocolate drops;     his coat was all pancakes, with jam for a border,     and a girdle of biscuits to keep it in order;     and he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,     a cloak of green cabbage-leaves stitched all together.      he had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,     of all sorts of beasticles, birdlings, and boys;     and from every long street and dark lane in the town     beasts, birdies, and boys in a tumult rushed down.     two cows and a calf ate his cabbage-leaf cloak;     four apes seized his girdle, which vanished like smoke;     three kids ate up half of his pancaky coat,     and the tails were devour'd by an ancient he goat;     an army of dogs in a twinkling tore up his     pork waistcoat and trowsers to give to their puppies;     and while they were growling, and mumbling the chops,     ten boys prigged the jujubes and chocolate drops.     he tried to run back to his house, but in vain,     for scores of fat pigs came again and again:     they rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;     they tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;     and now from the housetops with screechings descend     striped, spotted, white, black, and gray cats without end:     they jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,     when crows, ducks, and hens made a mincemeat of that;     they speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,     and utterly tore up his shirt of dead mice;     they swallowed the last of his shirt with a squall,--     whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.      and he said to himself, as he bolted the door,    i will not wear a similar dress any more,     any more, any more, any more, never more!     mr. and mrs. discobbolos.                      i.      mr. and mrs. discobbolos         climbed to the top of a wall.       and they sate to watch the sunset sky,       and to hear the nupiter piffkin cry,         and the biscuit buffalo call.     they took up a roll and some camomile tea,     and both were as happy as happy could be,             till mrs. discobbolos said,--            oh! w! x! y! z!             it has just come into my head,       suppose we should happen to fall!!!!!                         darling mr. discobbolos!                       ii.     suppose we should fall down flumpetty,         just like pieces of stone,       on to the thorns, or into the moat,       what would become of your new green coat?         and might you not break a bone?     it never occurred to me before,     that perhaps we shall never go down any more!             and mrs. discobbolos said,            oh! w! x! y! z!             what put it into your head       to climb up this wall, my own                         darling mr. discobbolos?                       iii.      mr. discobbolos answered,        at first it gave me pain,       and i felt my ears turn perfectly pink       when your exclamation made me think         we might never get down again!     but now i believe it is wiser far     to remain for ever just where we are.             and mr. discobbolos said,            oh! w! x! y! z!             it has just come into my head       we shall never go down again,                         dearest mrs. discobbolos!                       iv.      so mr. and mrs. discobbolos         stood up and began to sing,--      far away from hurry and strife       here we will pass the rest of life,         ding a dong, ding dong, ding!     we want no knives nor forks nor chairs,     no tables nor carpets nor household cares;             from worry of life we've fled;             oh! w! x! y! z!             there is no more trouble ahead,       sorrow or any such thing,                         for mr. and mrs. discobbolos!     the quangle wangle's hat.                        i.      on the top of the crumpetty tree         the quangle wangle sat,     but his face you could not see,         on account of his beaver hat.     for his hat was a hundred and two feet wide,     with ribbons and bibbons on every side,     and bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,     so that nobody ever could see the face             of the quangle wangle quee.                       ii.      the quangle wangle said         to himself on the crumpetty tree,     jam, and jelly, and bread         are the best of food for me!     but the longer i live on this crumpetty tree     the plainer than ever it seems to me     that very few people come this way     and that life on the whole is far from gay!             said the quangle wangle quee.                       iii.      but there came to the crumpetty tree         mr. and mrs. canary;     and they said, did ever you see         any spot so charmingly airy?     may we build a nest on your lovely hat?     mr. quangle wangle, grant us that!     o please let us come and build a nest     of whatever material suits you best,             mr. quangle wangle quee!                       iv.      and besides, to the crumpetty tree         came the stork, the duck, and the owl;     the snail and the bumble-bee,         the frog and the fimble fowl     (the fimble fowl, with a corkscrew leg);     and all of them said, we humbly beg     we may build our homes on your lovely hat,--     mr. quangle wangle, grant us that!        mr. quangle wangle quee!                       v.      and the golden grouse came there,         and the pobble who has no toes,     and the small olympian bear,         and the dong with a luminous nose.     and the blue baboon who played the flute,     and the orient calf from the land of tute,     and the attery squash, and the bisky bat,--     all came and built on the lovely hat       of the quangle wangle quee.                      vi.      and the quangle wangle said         to himself on the crumpetty tree,     when all these creatures move         what a wonderful noise there'll be!     and at night by the light of the mulberry moon     they danced to the flute of the blue baboon,     on the broad green leaves of the crumpetty tree,     and all were as happy as happy could be,       with the quangle wangle quee.     the cummerbund. an indian poem.                      i.  she sate upon her dobie,     to watch the evening star, and all the punkahs, as they passed,     cried, my! how fair you are! around her bower, with quivering leaves,     the tall kamsamahs grew, and kitmutgars in wild festoons     hung down from tchokis blue.                       ii.  below her home the river rolled     with soft meloobious sound, where golden-finned chuprassies swam,     in myriads circling round. above, on tallest trees remote     green ayahs perched alone, and all night long the mussak moan'd     its melancholy tone.                       iii.  and where the purple nullahs threw     their branches far and wide, and silvery goreewallahs flew     in silence, side by side, the little bheesties' twittering cry     rose on the flagrant air, and oft the angry jampan howled     deep in his hateful lair.                       iv.  she sate upon her dobie,     she heard the nimmak hum, when all at once a cry arose,     the cummerbund is come! in vain she fled: with open jaws     the angry monster followed, and so (before assistance came)     that lady fair was swollowed.                       v.  they sought in vain for even a bone     respectfully to bury; they said, hers was a dreadful fate!

 eggs and butter and cake, mr. wolf.  where are you going with them, little red riding hood?  i am going to my grandmother, who is ill, mr. wolf.  where does your grandmother live, little red riding hood?  along that path, past the wild rose bushes, then through the gate at the end of the wood, mr. wolf.  then mr. wolf again said good morning and set off, and little red riding hood again went in search of wild flowers.  at last he reached the porch covered with flowers and knocked at the door of the cottage.  who is there? called the grandmother.  little red riding hood, said the wicked wolf.  press the latch, open the door, and walk in, said the grandmother.  the wolf pressed the latch, and walked in where the grandmother lay in bed. he made one jump at her, but she jumped out of bed into a closet. then the wolf put on the cap which she had dropped and crept under the bedclothes.  in a short while little red riding hood knocked at the door, and walked in, saying, good morning, grandmother, i have brought you eggs, butter and cake, and here is a bunch of flowers i gathered in the wood. as she came nearer the bed she said, what big ears you have, grandmother.  all the better to hear you with, my dear.  what big eyes you have, grandmother.  all the better to see you with, my dear.  but, grandmother, what a big nose you have.  all the better to smell with, my dear.  but, grandmother, what a big mouth you have.  all the better to eat you up with, my dear, he said as he sprang at little red riding hood.  just at that moment little red riding hood's father was passing the cottage and heard her scream. he rushed in and with his axe chopped off mr. wolf's head.  everybody was happy that little red riding hood had escaped the wolf. then little red riding hood's father carried her home and they lived happily ever after.     the goose-girl   there was once an old queen who had a very beautiful daughter. the time came when the maiden was to go into a distant country to be married. the old queen packed up everything suitable to a royal outfit.  she also sent a waiting-woman with her. when the hour of departure came they bade each other a sorrowful farewell and set out for the bridegroom's country.  when they had ridden for a time the princess became very thirsty, and said to the waiting-woman, go down and fetch me some water in my cup from the stream. i must have something to drink.  if you are thirsty, said the waiting-woman, dismount yourself, lie down by the water and drink. i don't choose to be your servant.  being very thirsty, the princess dismounted, and knelt by the flowing water.  now, when she was about to mount her horse again, the waiting-woman said, by rights your horse belongs to me; this jade will do for you!  the poor little princess was obliged to give way. then the waiting-woman, in a harsh voice, ordered her to take off her royal robes, and to put on her own mean garments. finally she forced her to swear that she would not tell a person at the court what had taken place. had she not taken the oath she would have been killed on the spot.  there was great rejoicing when they arrived at the castle. the prince hurried towards them, and lifted the waiting-woman from her horse, thinking she was his bride. she was led upstairs, but the real princess had to stay below.  the old king looked out of the window and saw the delicate, pretty little creature standing in the courtyard; so he asked the bride about her companion.  i picked her up on the way, and brought her with me for company. give the girl something to do to keep her from idling.  the old king said, i have a little lad who looks after the geese; she may help him.  the boy was called little conrad, and the real bride was sent with him to look after the geese. when they reached the meadow, the princess sat down on the grass and let down her hair, and when conrad saw it he was so delighted that he wanted to pluck some out; but she said--    blow, blow, little breeze,   and conrad's hat seize.   let him join in the chase   while away it is whirled,   till my tresses are curled   and i rest in my place.  then a strong wind sprang up, which blew away conrad's hat right over the fields, and he had to run after it. when he came back her hair was all put up again.  when they got home conrad went to the king and said, i won't tend the geese with that maiden again.  why not? asked the king.  then conrad went on to tell the king all that had happened in the field. the king ordered conrad to go next day as usual and he followed into the field and hid behind a bush. he saw it happen just as conrad had told him. thereupon he went away unnoticed; and in the evening, when the goose-girl came home, he asked her why she did all these things.  that i may not tell you, she answered.  then he said, if you won't tell me, then tell the iron stove there; and he went away.  she crept up to the stove and unburdened her heart to it. the king stood outside by the pipes of the stove and heard all she said. then he came back, and caused royal robes to be put upon her, and her beauty was a marvel. then he called his son and told him that he had a false bride, but that the true bride was here.  the prince was charmed with her beauty and a great banquet was prepared. the bridegroom sat at the head of the table, with the princess on one side and the waiting-woman at the other; but she did not recognize the princess.  when they had eaten, the king put a riddle to the waiting-woman. what does a person deserve that deceives his master? telling the whole story.  the false bride answered, he must be put into a barrel and dragged along by two white horses till he is dead.  that is your doom, said the king, and the judgment shall be carried out.  when the sentence was fulfilled, the young prince married his true bride, and they lived together in peace and happiness.     babes in the wood   once upon a time there lived two little children whose parents were ill unto death. they begged their brother to care for the two little ones as he would his own.  the uncle promised he would be a father to them, but he soon began to scheme to possess the money the parents had left in his care for the children. he sent for two robbers and bargained with them to take the two babes into the woods and kill them.  after going many miles into the woods one of the robbers said, let us not kill the little children, they never harmed us. the other robber would not consent, so they came to blows. this frightened the children so much that they ran away and did not see the robbers again.  they wandered on and on until they became so tired and hungry that at length they sat down at the foot of a tree and cried as if their hearts would break. the little birds heard them and began to trill sweet lullabies, which presently lulled them to rest.  the birdies knew that the children would die of cold and hunger, so they covered them with leaves of crimson and brown and green. they then told the angels in heaven the sad story of the lost babes, and one of the white-robed angels flew down to earth and carried both the little ones back to heaven, so that when they awoke they were no longer tired and hungry, but were again with their dear mother.     the sleeping beauty   once upon a time there was a king and queen who for a very long time had no children, and when at length a little daughter was born to them they were so pleased that they gave a christening feast to which they invited a number of fairies. but, unfortunately, they left out one rather cross old fairy, and she was so angry that she said the princess should die when she reached the age of sixteen, by pricking her hand with a spindle.  all the other fairies present, except one, had already given the princess their beautiful gifts, and this last one said she could not prevent part of the wicked wish coming true; but her gift should be that the princess should not really die, but only fall into a deep sleep, which should last for a hundred years, and at the end of that time she should be awakened by a king's son.  it all happened as the fairies had predicted. when the princess was sixteen years old she saw an old woman spinning and took the spindle from her to try this strange new work. instantly she pricked her hand and fell into a deep sleep, as did everyone else in the palace. there she lay in a bower of roses, year after year, and the hedge around the palace garden grew so tall and thick that at last you could not have told that there was a castle at all.  at the end of the hundred years a king's son heard of the castle and the enchanted princess who lay asleep there and determined to rescue her. so he cut his way through the thick prickly hedge and at length he came to the princess. when he saw how lovely and how sweet she looked he fell in love with her and, stooping, kissed her lips.  at once she awoke and with her the king and queen and all the courtiers, who had fallen asleep at the same time.  as the princess was as much taken with the prince's appearance as he was with hers, they decided to be married. and so the wedding was celebrated the same day with great pomp and ceremony.     snowdrop and seven little dwarfs   once upon a time there was a little princess called snowdrop, who had a cruel step-mother who was jealous of her. the queen had a magic mirror, which could speak to her, and when she looked into it and asked who was the fairest lady in the land the mirror told her she was, for she was very beautiful; but as snowdrop grew up she became still more lovely than her step-mother and the mirror did not fail to tell the queen this.  so she ordered one of her huntsmen to take snowdrop away and kill her; but he was too tender-hearted to do this and left the maiden in the wood and went home again. snowdrop wandered about until she came to the house of seven little dwarfs, and they were so kind as to take her in and let her live with them. she used to make their seven little beds, and prepare the meals for the seven little men, and they were all quite happy until the queen found out from her mirror that snowdrop was alive still, for, as it always told the truth, it still told her snowdrop was the fairest lady in the land.  she decided that snowdrop must die, so she dyed her face and dressed up like an old pedlar, and in this disguise she went to the home of the seven dwarfs and called out, laces for sale.  snowdrop peeped out of the window and said, good-day, mother; what have you to sell?  good laces, fine laces, laces of every color, and she held out one that was made of gay silk.  snowdrop opened the door and bought the pretty lace.  child, said the old woman, you are a sight, let me lace you properly for once.  snowdrop placed herself before the old woman, who laced her so quickly and so tightly that she took away snowdrop's breath and she fell down as though dead.  not long after the seven dwarfs came home they found that she was laced too tight and cut the lace, whereupon snowdrop began to breathe and soon came back to life again.  when the queen got home and found by asking her mirror that snowdrop was still alive, she planned to make an end of her for good, so she made a poisoned comb and disguised herself to look like a different old woman.  she journeyed to the dwarfs' home and induced snowdrop to let her comb her hair. the minute she put the poisoned comb in her hair snowdrop fell down as though dead.  when the seven dwarfs came home they found their poor snowdrop on the floor, and suspecting the bad queen began to look for the cause, soon finding the comb. no sooner had they removed it than snowdrop came to life again.  upon the queen's return home she found by asking her mirror that snowdrop still lived, so she disguised herself a third time and came to the dwarfs' little house and gave snowdrop a poisoned apple. as soon as the little princess took a bite it stuck in her throat and choked her.  oh! how grieved were the good little dwarfs. they made a fine glass coffin, and put snowdrop into it and were carrying her away to bury her when they met a prince, who fell in love with the little dead maiden, and begged the dwarfs to give her to him.  the dwarfs were so sorry for him they consented, and the prince's servants were about to carry the coffin away when they stumbled and fell over the root of a tree. snowdrop received such a violent jerk that the poisonous apple was jerked right out of her throat and she sat up alive and well again.  of course she married the prince, and she, her husband and the good little dwarfs lived happily ever after, but the cruel step-mother came to a bad end, and no one was even sorry for her.\",\n          \"one morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.  he pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.  a gig was coming along the road; it was driven by mr. mcgregor, and beside him sat mrs. mcgregor in her best bonnet.  as soon as they had passed, little benjamin bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of mr. mcgregor's garden.      that wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived benjamin's aunt and his cousins--flopsy, mopsy, cotton-tail, and peter.  old mrs. rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (i once bought a pair at a bazaar). she also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).  little benjamin did not very much want to see his aunt.  he came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin peter.      peter was sitting by himself. he looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.  peter, said little benjamin, in a whisper, who has got your clothes?  peter replied, the scarecrow in mr. mcgregor's garden, and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.  little benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that mr. mcgregor had gone out in a gig, and mrs. mcgregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.      peter said he hoped that it would rain.  at this point old mrs. rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: cotton-tail! cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!  peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.  they went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. from here they looked down into mr. mcgregor's garden. peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of mr. mcgregor's.      little benjamin said: it spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.  peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.  it had been sown with lettuces.  they left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little benjamin, who was wearing clogs.      little benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.  they took them off the scarecrow. there had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.  benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.  then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his aunt.  peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.       benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. he said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their sunday dinner.  (the name of little benjamin's papa was old mr. benjamin bunny.)  the lettuces certainly were very fine.  peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. presently he dropped half the onions.      little benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. he led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. they went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.  the mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at peter rabbit and little benjamin bunny.  presently peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.      they got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!  he was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.  this is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!  little benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and peter and the onions underneath a large basket....      the cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.  perhaps she liked the smell of onions!  anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.  she sat there for five hours.                                       i cannot draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry.  the sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.      at length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.  the cat looked up and saw old mr. benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.  he was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.  he was looking for his son.  old mr. bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.  he took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.  the cat was too much surprised to scratch back.      when old mr. bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.  then he came back to the basket and took out his son benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.  then he took out his nephew peter.  then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.    when mr. mcgregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.  it looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!  also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse, locking the door upon the outside.      when peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. cotton-tail and peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old mrs. rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco. a farmyard tale     for     ralph and betsy      what a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!  --listen to the story of jemima puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.    her sister-in-law, mrs. rebeccah puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else--i have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, jemima. you would let them go cold; you know you would!  i wish to hatch my own eggs; i will hatch them all by myself, quacked jemima puddle-duck.    she tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.  jemima puddle-duck became quite desperate. she determined to make a nest right away from the farm.    she set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill.  she was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.    when she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.  she thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.    jemima puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. she ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.    she flew beautifully when she had got a good start.  she skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.    jemima alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place. she rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves.  but--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.  he had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.  quack? said jemima puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side--quack?    the gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at jemima--  madam, have you lost your way? said he. he had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.  jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. she explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place.    ah! is that so? indeed! said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at jemima. he folded up the newspaper, and put it in his coat-tail pocket.  jemima complained of the superfluous hen.  indeed! how interesting! i wish i could meet with that fowl. i would teach it to mind its own business!    but as to a nest--there is no difficulty: i have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. no, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. you may sit there as long as you like, said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.  he led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves.  it was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.    this is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient, said the hospitable gentleman.  there was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes. the gentleman opened the door, and showed jemima in.    the shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.  jemima puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. but it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.    when she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.  he was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let jemima go home for the night. he promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day.  he said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed.    jemima puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. they were greeny white and very large. the foxy gentleman admired them immensely. he used to turn them over and count them when jemima was not there.  at last jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--and i will bring a bag of corn with me, so that i need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. they might catch cold, said the conscientious jemima.    madam, i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; i will provide oats. but before you commence your tedious sitting, i intend to give you a treat. let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!  may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. i will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelette, said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.    jemima puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.  she went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.    and she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.  the collie-dog kep met her coming out, what are you doing with those onions? where do you go every afternoon by yourself, jemima puddle-duck?  jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.  the collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.    he asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed.  then he went out, and trotted down the village. he went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.    jemima puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. she was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.  she flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.    he was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. when jemima alighted he quite jumped.  come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. give me the herbs for the omelette. be sharp!  he was rather abrupt. jemima puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.  she felt surprised, and uncomfortable.    while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it.  jemima became much alarmed.    a moment afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans.  and nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.  presently kep opened the door of the shed, and let out jemima puddle-duck.    unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.  he had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.    jemima puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.    she laid some more in june, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched.  jemima puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter. once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie, who lived at a farm called little-town. she was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!  one day little lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so! i've lost my pocket-handkin! three handkins and a pinny! have you seen them, tabby kitten?    the kitten went on washing her white paws; so lucie asked a speckled hen--  sally henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins?  but the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--  i go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!      and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig.  cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.  lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  and a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.    lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!    presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.  some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! and where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a very small person.  lucie ran on, and on.    the path ended under a big rock. the grass was short and green, and there were clothes--props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  but there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      lily-white and clean, oh!      with little frills between, oh!       smooth and hot--red rusty spot      never here be seen, oh!    lucie, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. a little frightened voice called out who's that?  lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. only the ceiling was so low that lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.    there was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at lucie.  her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where lucie had yellow curls--that little person had prickles!    who are you? said lucie. have you seen my pocket-handkins?  the little person made a bob-curtsey--oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is mrs. tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, i'm an excellent clear-starcher! and she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.    what's that thing? said lucie--that's not my pocket-handkin?  oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to cock robin!  and she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.    then she took something else off a clothes-horse--  that isn't my pinny? said lucie.  oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to jenny wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! it's very bad to wash! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    mrs. tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.    there's one of my pocket-handkins! cried lucie--and there's my pinny!  mrs. tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.  oh that is lovely! said lucie.    and what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?  oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to sally henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! she'll very soon go barefoot! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    why, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?  oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old mrs. rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! i've had to wash it separately, i can't get out the smell.  there's another one of mine, said lucie.    what are those funny little white things?  that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten; i only have to iron them; she washes them herself.  there's my last pocket-handkin! said lucie.    and what are you dipping into the basin of starch?  they're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to tom titmouse--most terrible particular! said mrs. tiggy-winkle. now i've finished my ironing; i'm going to air some clothes.    what are these dear soft fluffy things? said lucie.  oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at skelghyl.  will their jackets take off? asked lucie.  oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. and here's one marked for gatesgarth, and three that come from little-town. they're always marked at washing! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!    then mrs. tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for lucie. they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. mrs. tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that lucie didn't like to sit too near her.    when they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.  and then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.    then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs. tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!  all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny!    and she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs. tiggy-winkle.    so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except lucie's one little bundle.    lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say good-night, and to thank the washer-woman--but what a very odd thing! mrs. tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!  she was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?    and how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with prickles!  why! mrs. tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog.                                           (now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the     stile--but then how could she have found three clean     pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?      and besides--i have seen that door into the back of the hill     called cat bells--and besides i am very well acquainted with     dear mrs. tiggy-winkle!) once upon a time there were four little rabbits, and their names were--            flopsy,        mopsy,    cotton-tail, and peter.  they lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.  'now my dears,' said old mrs. rabbit one morning, 'you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into mr. mcgregor's garden: your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by mrs. mcgregor.'  'now run along, and don't get into mischief. i am going out.'  then old mrs. rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.  flopsy, mopsy, and cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries:  but peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to mr. mcgregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!  first he ate some lettuces and some french beans; and then he ate some radishes;  and then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.  but round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but mr. mcgregor!  mr. mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after peter, waving a rake and calling out, 'stop thief!'  peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.  he lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.  after losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that i think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. it was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.  peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.  mr. mcgregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of peter; but peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.  and rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.  mr. mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. he began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.  presently peter sneezed--'kertyschoo!' mr. mcgregor was after him in no time.  and tried to put his foot upon peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. the window was too small for mr. mcgregor, and he was tired of running after peter. he went back to his work.  peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. also he was very damp with sitting in that can.  after a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all round.  he found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.  an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. she only shook her head at him. peter began to cry.  then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. presently, he came to a pond where mr. mcgregor filled his water-cans. a white cat was staring at some gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little benjamin bunny.  he went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. peter scuttered underneath the bushes. but presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. the first thing he saw was mr. mcgregor hoeing onions. his back was turned towards peter, and beyond him was the gate!  peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.  mr. mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner, but peter did not care. he slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.  mr. mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.  peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.  he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. his mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight!  i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening.  his mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to peter!  'one table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'  but flopsy, mopsy, and cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper. this is a tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was nutkin.  he had a brother called twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.    in the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called old brown.    one autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green--nutkin and twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.    they made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to owl island to gather nuts.  each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.    they also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for old brown, and put them down upon his door-step.  then twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--  old mr. brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?    but nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. he bobbed up and down like a little red cherry, singing--      riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!      a little wee man, in a red red coat!      a staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;      if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a groat.  now this riddle is as old as the hills; mr. brown paid no attention whatever to nutkin.  he shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.    but next morning they all came back again to owl island; and twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of old brown's doorway, and said--  mr. brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?    but nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old mr. brown with a nettle and singing--      old mr. b! riddle-me-ree!      hitty pitty within the wall,      hitty pitty without the wall;      if you touch hitty pitty,      hitty pitty will bite you!  mr. brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.    he shut the door in nutkin's face. presently a little thread of blue smoke from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--      a house full, a hole full!      and you cannot gather a bowl-full!      the squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.  but nutkin gathered oak-apples--yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old mr. brown.    on the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for old brown.  they paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on owl island.    twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. he ran in front, singing--      the man in the wilderness said to me,     'how many strawberries grow in the sea?'      i answered him as i thought good--      'as many red herrings as grow in the wood.'  but old mr. brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.    on the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in plum-pudding for old brown. each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.  but nutkin sang as rudely as ever--       old mr. b! riddle-me-ree       flour of england, fruit of spain,       met together in a shower of rain;       put in a bag tied round with a string,     if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a ring!   which was ridiculous of nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to old brown.    the other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but nutkin gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins.    on the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. they had stolen it out of a bumble bees' nest on the tippitty top of the hill.  but nutkin skipped up and down, singing--      hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! hum-a-bum buzz!       as i went over tipple-tine       i met a flock of bonny swine;     some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!       they were the very bonniest swine       that e'er went over tipple-tine.    old mr. brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of nutkin.  but he ate up the honey!    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.  but nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.    on the sixth day, which was saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid egg in a little rush basket as a last parting present for old brown.  but nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--      humpty dumpty lies in the beck,      with a white counterpane round his neck,      forty doctors and forty wrights,      cannot put humpty dumpty to rights!    now old mr. brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. but still he did not speak.    nutkin became more and more impertinent--        old mr. b! old mr. b!     hickamore, hackamore, on the king's kitchen door;     all the king's horses, and all the king's men,     couldn't drive hickamore, hackamore,     off the king's kitchen door.  nutkin danced up and down like a sunbeam; but still old brown said nothing at all.    nutkin began again--      arthur o'bower has broken his band,      he comes roaring up the land!      the king of scots with all his power,      cannot turn arthur of the bower!  nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the wind, and he took a running jump right onto the head of old brown!...  then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud squeak!  the other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.    when they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree--there was old brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.                                       but nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!    this looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.    old brown carried nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic window.    and to this day, if you meet nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--  cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k! once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were mittens, tom kitten, and moppet.  they had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.  but one day their mother--mrs. tabitha twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.      first she scrubbed their faces (this one is moppet).  then she brushed their fur, (this one is mittens).      then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is tom kitten).  tom was very naughty, and he scratched.  mrs. tabitha dressed moppet and mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son thomas.      tom kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. his mother sewed them on again.  when the three kittens were ready, mrs. tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.  now keep your frocks clean, children! you must walk on your hind legs. keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from sally henny penny, and from the pig-stye and the puddle-ducks.      moppet and mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.  when they stood up there were several green smears!  let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall, said moppet.  they turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.      tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. he came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left.  he was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.  moppet and mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.      while they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step--pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!  they stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. they had very small eyes and looked surprised.      then the two duck-birds, rebeccah and jemima puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.  mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. moppet and tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of tom's clothes came off on the way down.  come! mr. drake puddle-duck, said moppet--come and help us to dress him! come and button up tom!      mr. drake puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles.  but he put them on himself! they fitted him even worse than tom kitten.  it's a very fine morning! said mr. drake puddle-duck.      and he and jemima and rebeccah puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!  then tabitha twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.      she pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.  my friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; i am affronted, said mrs. tabitha twitchit.  she sent them upstairs; and i am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true.      quite the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least.  somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.  and i think that some day i shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about tom kitten!    as for the puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.  the clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.      and mr. drake puddle-duck, and jemima and rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.\",\n          \"the following lines by mr. lear were written for a young lady of his acquaintance, who had quoted to him the words of a young lady not of his acquaintance,    how pleasant to know mr. lear!        how pleasant to know mr. lear!         who has written such volumes of stuff!       some think him ill-tempered and queer,         but a few think him pleasant enough.        his mind is concrete and fastidious,         his nose is remarkably big;       his visage is more or less hideous,         his beard it resembles a wig.        he has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers,         leastways if you reckon two thumbs;       long ago he was one of the singers,         but now he is one of the dumbs.        he sits in a beautiful parlor,         with hundreds of books on the wall;       he drinks a great deal of marsala,         but never gets tipsy at all.        he has many friends, lay men and clerical,         old foss is the name of his cat;       his body is perfectly spherical,         he weareth a runcible hat.        when he walks in waterproof white,         the children run after him so!       calling out, he's come out in his night-         gown, that crazy old englishman, oh!        he weeps by the side of the ocean,         he weeps on the top of the hill;       he purchases pancakes and lotion,         and chocolate shrimps from the mill.        he reads, but he cannot speak, spanish,         he cannot abide ginger beer:       ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,         how pleasant to know mr. lear!                                              introduction.  edward lear, the artist, author of journals of a landscape painter in various out-of-the-way countries, and of the delightful books of nonsense, which have amused successive generations of children, died on sunday, january 29, 1888, at san remo, italy, where he had lived for twenty years. few names could evoke a wider expression of passing regret at their appearance in the obituary column; for until his health began to fail he was known to an immense and almost a cosmopolitan circle of acquaintance, and popular wherever he was known. fewer still could call up in the minds of intimate friends a deeper and more enduring feeling of sorrow for personal loss, mingled with the pleasantest of memories; for it was impossible to know him thoroughly and not to love him. london, rome, the mediterranean countries generally, ceylon and india, are still all dotted with survivors among his generation who will mourn for him affectionately, although his latter years were spent in comparatively close retirement. he was a man of striking nobility of nature, fearless, independent, energetic, given to forming for himself strong opinions, often hastily, sometimes bitterly; not always strong or sound in judgment, but always seeking after truth in every matter, and following it as he understood it in scorn of consequence; utterly unselfish, devoted to his friends, generous even to extravagance towards any one who had ever been connected with his fortunes or his travels; playful, light-hearted, witty, and humorous, but not without those occasional fits of black depression and nervous irritability to which such temperaments are liable.  great and varied as the merits of his pictures are, lear hardly succeeded in achieving any great popularity as a landscape-painter. his work was frequently done on private commission, and he rarely sent in pictures for the academy or other exhibitions. his larger and more highly finished landscapes were unequal in technical perfection,--sometimes harsh or cold in color, or stiff in composition; sometimes full of imagination, at others literal and prosaic,--but always impressive reproductions of interesting or peculiar scenery. in later years he used in conversation to qualify himself as a topographical artist; and the definition was true, though not exhaustive. he had an intuitive and a perfectly trained eye for the character and beauty of distant mountain lines, the solemnity of rocky gorges, the majesty of a single mountain rising from a base of plain or sea; and he was equally exact in rendering the true forms of the middle distances and the specialties of foreground detail belonging to the various lands through which he had wandered as a sketcher. some of his pictures show a mastery which has rarely been equalled over the difficulties of painting an immense plain as seen from a height, reaching straight away from the eye of the spectator until it is lost in a dim horizon. sir roderick murchison used to say that he always understood the geological peculiarities of a country he had only studied in lear's sketches. the compliment was thoroughly justified; and it is not every landscape-painter to whom it could honestly be paid.  the history of lear's choice of a career was a curious one. he was the youngest of twenty-one children, and, through a family mischance, was thrown entirely on the limited resources of an elderly sister at a very early age. as a boy he had always dabbled in colors for his own amusement, and had been given to poring over the ordinary boys' books upon natural history. it occurred to him to try to turn his infant talents to account; and he painted upon cardboard a couple of birds in the style which the older among us remember as having been called oriental tinting, took them to a small shop, and sold them for fourpence. the kindness of friends, to whom he was ever grateful, gave him the opportunity of more serious and more remunerative study, and he became a patient and accurate zo\\u00f6logical draughtsman. many of the birds in the earlier volumes of gould's magnificent folios were drawn for him by lear. a few years back there were eagles alive in the zo\\u00f6logical gardens in regent's park to which lear could point as old familiar friends that he had drawn laboriously from claw to beak fifty years before. he united with this kind of work the more unpleasant occupation of drawing the curiosities of disease or deformity in hospitals. one day, as he was busily intent on the portrait of a bird in the zo\\u00f6logical gardens, an old gentleman came and looked over his shoulder, entered into conversation, and finally said to him, you must come and draw my birds at knowsley. lear did not know where knowsley was, or what it meant; but the old gentleman was the thirteenth earl of derby. the successive earls of derby have been among lear's kindest and most generous patrons. he went to knowsley, and the drawings in the knowsley menagerie (now a rare and highly-prized work among book collectors) are by lear's hand. at knowsley he became a permanent favorite; and it was there that he composed in prolific succession his charming and wonderful series of utterly nonsensical rhymes and drawings. lear had already begun seriously to study landscape. when english winters began to threaten his health, lord derby started a subscription which enabled him to go to rome as a student and artist, and no doubt gave him recommendations among anglo-roman society which laid the foundations of a numerous client\\u00e8le. it was in the roman summers that lear first began to exercise the taste for pictorial wandering which grew into a habit and a passion, to fill vivid and copious note-books as he went, and to illustrate them by spirited and accurate drawings; and his first volume of illustrated excursions in italy, published in 1846, is gratefully dedicated to his knowsley patron.  only those who have travelled with him could know what a delightful comrade he was to men whose tastes ran more or less parallel to his own. it was not everybody who could travel with him; for he was so irrepressibly anxious not to lose a moment of the time at his disposal for gathering into his garners the beauty and interest of the lands over which he journeyed, that he was careless of comfort and health. calabria, sicily, the desert of sinai, egypt and nubia, greece and albania, palestine, syria, athos, candia, montenegro, zag\\u00f3ri (who knows now where zag\\u00f3ri is, or was?), were as thoroughly explored and sketched by him as the more civilized localities of malta, corsica, and corfu. he read insatiably before starting all the recognized guide-books and histories of the country he intended to draw; and his published itineraries are marked by great strength and literary interest quite irrespectively of the illustrations. and he had his reward. it is not any ordinary journalist and sketcher who could have compelled from tennyson such a tribute as lines to e.l. on his travels in greece:--      illyrian woodlands, echoing falls       of water, sheets of summer glass,       the long divine pene\\u00efan pass,     the vast akrokeraunian walls,      tomohrit, athos, all things fair,       with such a pencil, such a pen,       you shadow forth to distant men,     i read and felt that i was there.  lear was a man to whom, as to tennyson's ulysses,      all experience is an arch wherethrough     gleams that untravelled world.  after settling at san remo, and when he was nearly sixty years old, he determined to visit india and ceylon. he started once and failed, being taken so ill at suez that he was obliged to return. the next year he succeeded, and brought away some thousands of drawings of the most striking views from all three presidencies and from the tropical island. his appetite for travel continued to grow with what it fed upon; and although he hated a long sea-voyage, he used seriously to contemplate as possible a visit to relations in new zealand. it may safely, however, be averred that no considerations would have tempted him to visit the arctic regions.      a hard-working life, checkered by the odd adventures which happen     to the odd and the adventurous and pass over the commonplace; a     career brightened by the high appreciation of unimpeachable     critics; lightened, till of late, by the pleasant society and good     wishes of innumerable friends; saddened by the growing pressure of     ill health and solitude; cheered by his constant trust in the love     and sympathy of those who knew him best, however far away,--such     was the life of edward lear.        --the london saturday review, feb. 4, 1888.  among the writers who have striven with varying success during the last thirty or forty years to awaken the merriment of the rising generation of the time being, mr. edward lear occupies the first place in seniority, if not in merit. the parent of modern nonsense-writers, he is distinguished from all his followers and imitators by the superior consistency with which he has adhered to his aim,--that of amusing his readers by fantastic absurdities, as void of vulgarity or cynicism as they are incapable of being made to harbor any symbolical meaning. he never deviates into sense; but those who appreciate him never feel the need of such deviation. he has a genius for coining absurd names and words, which, even when they are suggested by the exigencies of his metre, have a ludicrous appropriateness to the matter in hand. his verse is, with the exception of a certain number of cockney rhymes, wonderfully flowing and even melodious--or, as he would say, meloobious--while to all these qualifications for his task must finally be added the happy gift of pictorial expression, enabling him to double, nay, often to quadruple, the laughable effect of his text by an inexhaustible profusion of the quaintest designs. generally speaking, these designs are, as it were, an idealization of the efforts of a clever child; but now and then--as in the case of the nonsense-botany--mr. lear reminds us what a genuine and graceful artist he really is. the advantage to a humorist of being able to illustrate his own text has been shown in the case of thackeray and mr. w.s. gilbert, to mention two familiar examples; but in no other instance of such a combination have we discovered such geniality as is to be found in the nonsense-pictures of mr. lear. we have spoken above of the melodiousness of mr. lear's verses, a quality which renders them excellently suitable for musical setting, and which has not escaped the notice of the author himself. we have also heard effective arrangements, presumably by other composers, of the adventures of the table and the chair, and of the cruise of the owl and the pussy-cat,--the latter introduced into the drawing-room entertainment of one of the followers of john parry. indeed, in these days of adaptations, it is to be wondered at that no enterprising librettist has attempted to build a children's comic opera out of the materials supplied in the four books with which we are now concerned. the first of these, originally published in 1846, and brought out in an enlarged form in 1863, is exclusively devoted to nonsense-verses of one type. mr. lear is careful to disclaim the credit of having created this type, for he tells us in the preface to his third book that the lines beginning, 'there was an old man of tobago,' were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse leading itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures. dismissing the further question of the authorship of there was an old man of tobago, we propose to give a few specimens of mr. lear's protean powers as exhibited in the variation of this simple type. here, to begin with, is a favorite verse, which we are very glad to have an opportunity of giving, as it is often incorrectly quoted, cocks being substituted for owls in the third line:      there was an old man with a beard,     who said, 'it is just as i feared!     two owls and a hen, four larks and a wren,     have all built their nests in my beard!'  with the kindly fatalism which is the distinctive note of the foregoing stanza, the sentiment of our next extract is in vivid contrast:--       there was an old man in a tree,     who was terribly bored by a bee;     when they said, 'does it buzz?' he replied, 'yes, it does!     it's a regular brute of a bee.'  to the foregoing verse an historic interest attaches, if, that is, we are right in supposing it to have inspired mr. gilbert with his famous nonsense-rhyme in blank verse. we quote from memory:--      there was an old man of st. bees,     who was stung in the arm by a wasp.     when they asked, 'does it hurt?' he replied, 'no, it doesn't,     but i thought all the while 'twas a hornet!'  passing over the lines referring to the young person of crete to whom the epithet ombliferous is applied, we may be pardoned--on the ground of the geographical proximity of the two countries named--for quoting together two stanzas which in reality are separated by a good many pages:--      there was a young lady of norway,     who casually sat in a doorway;     when the doors queezed her flat, she exclaimed, 'what of that?'     this courageous young person of norway.      there was a young lady of sweden,     who went by the slow train to weedon;     when they cried, 'weedon station!' she made no observation,     but thought she should go back to sweden.  a noticeable feature about this first book, and one which we think is peculiar to it, is the harsh treatment which the eccentricities of the inhabitants of certain towns appear to have met with at the hands of their fellow-residents. no less than three people are smashed,--the old man of whitehaven who danced a quadrille with a raven; the old person of buda; and the old man with a gong who bumped at it all the day long, though in the last-named case we admit that there was considerable provocation. before quitting the first nonsense-book, we would point out that it contains one or two forms that are interesting; for instance, scroobious, which we take to be a portmanteau word, and spickle-speckled, a favorite form of reduplication with mr. lear, and of which the best specimen occurs in his last book, he tinkledy-binkledy-winkled the bell. the second book, published in 1871, shows mr. lear in the maturity of sweet desipience, and will perhaps remain the favorite volume of the four to grown-up readers. the nonsense-songs are all good, and the story of the four little children who went round the world is the most exquisite piece of imaginative absurdity that the present writer is acquainted with. but before coming to that, let us quote a few lines from the jumblies, who, as all the world knows, went to sea in a sieve:--        they sailed to the western sea, they did,       to a land all covered with trees.     and they bought an owl, and a useful cart,     and a pound of rice, and a cranberry tart,       and a hive of silvery bees.     and they bought a pig, and some green jack-daws,     and a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,     and forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,       and no end of stilton cheese.         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live.         their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.     and in twenty years they all came back,       in twenty years or more,     and every one said, 'how tall they've grown!     for they've been to the lakes, and the torrible zone,       and the hills of the chankly bore.'  from the pedestrian excursion of the table and the chair, we cannot resist making a brief quotation, though in this, as in every case, the inability to quote the drawings also is a sad drawback:--      so they both went slowly down,     and walked about the town,     with a cheerful bumpy sound,     as they toddled round and round.     and everybody cried,     as they hastened to their side,     'see, the table and the chair     have come out to take the air!'      but in going down an alley     to a castle in a valley,     they completely lost their way,     and wandered all the day,     till, to see them safely back,     they paid a ducky-quack,     and a beetle and a mouse,     who took them to their house.      then they whispered to each other,     'o delightful little brother,     what a lovely walk we've taken!     let us dine on beans and bacon!'     so the ducky and the leetle     browny-mousy, and the beetle     dined, and danced upon their heads,     till they toddled to their beds.  the story of the four little children who went round the world follows next, and the account of the manner in which they occupied themselves while on shipboard may be transcribed for the benefit of those unfortunate persons who have not perused the original: during the day-time violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt-water into a churn, while her three brothers churned it violently in the hope it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did. after journeying for a time, they saw some land at a distance, and when they came to it they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. besides that it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses with a great gulf-stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, five hundred and three feet high. in a later passage, we read how by-and-by the children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. each of these blue bottles contained a bluebottlefly, and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony, nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. our last quotation from this inimitable recital shall be from the description of their adventure on a great plain where they espied an object which on a nearer approach and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cake and oyster-shells. this turned out to be the co-operative cauliflower, who, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust ... suddenly arose, and in a somewhat plumdomphious manner hurried off towards the setting sun, his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers ... till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand. so remarkable a sight of course impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.  in his third book, mr. lear takes occasion in an entertaining preface to repudiate the charge of harboring any ulterior motive beyond that of nonsense pure and absolute in any of his verses or pictures, and tells a delightful anecdote illustrative of the persistently absurd report that the earl of derby was the author of the first book of nonsense. in this volume he reverts once more to the familiar form adopted in his original efforts, and with little falling off. it is to be remarked that the third division is styled twenty-six nonsense rhymes and pictures, although there is no more rhyme than reason in any of the set. our favorite illustrations are those of the scroobious snake who always wore a hat on his head, for fear he should bite anybody, and the visibly vicious vulture who wrote some verses to a veal-cutlet in a volume bound in vellum. in the fourth and last of mr. lear's books, we meet not only with familiar words, but personages and places,--old friends like the jumblies, the yonghy-bonghy-bo, the quangle wangle, the hills of the chankly bore, and the great gromboolian plain, as well as new creations, such as the dong with a luminous nose, whose story is a sort of nonsense version of the love of nausicaa for ulysses, only that the sexes are inverted. in these verses, graceful fancy is so subtly interwoven with nonsense as almost to beguile us into feeling a real interest in mr. lear's absurd creations. so again in the pelican chorus there are some charming lines:--      by day we fish, and at eve we stand     on long bare islands of yellow sand.     and when the sun sinks slowly down,     and the great rock-walls grow dark and brown,     when the purple river rolls fast and dim,     and the ivory ibis starlike skim,     wing to wing we dance around, etc.  the other nonsense-poems are all good, but we have no space for further quotation, and will take leave of our subject by propounding the following set of examination questions which a friend who is deeply versed in mr. lear's books has drawn up for us:--    1. what do you gather from a study of mr. lear's works to      have been the prevalent characteristics of the inhabitants of      gretna, prague, thermopylae, wick, and hong kong?    2. state briefly what historical events are connected with      ischia, chertsey, whitehaven, boulak, and jellibolee.    3. comment, with illustrations, upon mr. lear's use of the      following words: runcible, propitious, dolomphious, borascible,      fizzgiggious, himmeltanious, tumble-dum-down, spongetaneous.    4. enumerate accurately all the animals who lived on the      quangle wangle's hat, and explain how the quangle wangle      was enabled at once to enlighten his five travelling companions      as to the true nature of the co-operative cauliflower.    5. what were the names of the five daughters of the old      person of china, and what was the purpose for which the      old man of the dargle purchased six barrels of gargle?    6. collect notices of king xerxes in mr. lear's works, and      state your theory, if you have any, as to the character and      appearance of nupiter piffkin.    7. draw pictures of the plum-pudding flea, and the moppsikon      floppsikon bear, and state by whom waterproof tubs      were first used.    8.         there was an old man at a station                who made a promiscuous oration.       what bearing may we assume the foregoing couplet to have      upon mr. lear's political views?                                    --the london spectator.                                               a book of nonsense  by  edward lear.  with all the original pictures and verses           there was an old derry down derry, who loved to see little folks   merry;     so he made them a book, and with laughter they shook       at the fun of that derry down derry.                     original dedication.                         to the  great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces            of edward, 13th earl of derby,           this book of drawings and verses       (the greater part of which were originally          made and composed for their parents.)                 is dedicated by the author,                                           edward lear.         london, 1862.                                                         there was an old man with a nose,     who said, if you choose to suppose     that my nose is too long, you are certainly wrong!     that remarkable man with a nose.            there was a young person of smyrna,     whose grandmother threatened to burn her;

    she walked seventy miles, and leaped fifteen stiles,     which astonished that girl of majorca.            there was a young lady of poole,     whose soup was excessively cool;     so she put it to boil by the aid of some oil,     that ingenious young lady of poole.            there was an old lady of prague,     whose language was horribly vague;     when they said, are these caps? she answered, perhaps!     that oracular lady of prague.            there was a young lady of parma,     whose conduct grew calmer and calmer:     when they said, are you dumb? she merely said, hum!     that provoking young lady of parma.            there was an old person of sparta,     who had twenty-five sons and one darter;     he fed them on snails, and weighed them in scales,     that wonderful person of sparta.            there was an old man on whose nose     most birds of the air could repose;     but they all flew away at the closing of day,     which relieved that old man and his nose.            there was a young lady of turkey,     who wept when the weather was murky;     when the day turned out fine, she ceased to repine,     that capricious young lady of turkey.            there was an old man of a\\u00f4sta     who possessed a large cow, but he lost her;     but they said, don't you see she has run up a tree,     you invidious old man of a\\u00f4sta?            there was a young person of crete,     whose toilette was far from complete;     she dressed in a sack spickle-speckled with black,     that ombliferous person of crete.            there was a young lady of clare,     who was madly pursued by a bear;     when she found she was tired, she abruptly expired,     that unfortunate lady of clare.            there was a young lady of dorking,     who bought a large bonnet for walking;     but its color and size so bedazzled her eyes,     that she very soon went back to dorking.            there was an old man of cape horn,     who wished he had never been born;     so he sat on a chair till he died of despair,     that dolorous man of cape horn.            there was an old person of cromer,     who stood on one leg to read homer;

    so he sate on a chair with his feet in the air,     that umbrageous old person of spain.            there was an old man who said, well!     will nobody answer this bell?     i have pulled day and night, till my hair has grown white,     but nobody answers this bell!            there was an old man with an owl,     who continued to bother and howl;     he sat on a rail, and imbibed bitter ale,     which refreshed that old man and his owl.            there was an old man in a casement,     who held up his hands in amazement;     when they said, sir, you'll fall! he replied, not at all!     that incipient old man in a casement.            there was an old person of ewell,     who chiefly subsisted on gruel;     but to make it more nice, he inserted some mice,     which refreshed that old person of ewell.            there was an old man of peru.     who never knew what he should do;     so he tore off his hair, and behaved like a bear,     that intrinsic old man of peru.            there was an old man with a beard,     who said, it is just as i feared!--     two owls and a hen, four larks and a wren,     have all built their nests in my beard.            there was a young lady whose eyes     were unique as to color and size;

too long we have tarried:       but what shall we do for a ring?     they sailed away, for a year and a day,       to the land where the bong-tree grows;     and there in a wood a piggy-wig stood,       with a ring at the end of his nose,           his nose,           his nose,       with a ring at the end of his nose.                       iii.      dear pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling       your ring? said the piggy, i will.     so they took it away, and were married next day       by the turkey who lives on the hill.     they dined on mince and slices of quince,       which they ate with a runcible spoon;     and hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,       they danced by the light of the moon,           the moon,           the moon,     they danced by the light of the moon.       the duck and the kangaroo.                        i.      said the duck to the kangaroo,        good gracious! how you hop     over the fields, and the water too,         as if you never would stop!     my life is a bore in this nasty pond;     and i long to go out in the world beyond:         i wish i could hop like you,         said the duck to the kangaroo.                       ii.     please give me a ride on your back,         said the duck to the kangaroo:    i would sit quite still, and say nothing but 'quack'         the whole of the long day through;     and we 'd go the dee, and the jelly bo lee,     over the land, and over the sea:         please take me a ride! oh, do!         said the duck to the kangaroo.                                       iii.      said the kangaroo to the duck,        this requires some little reflection.     perhaps, on the whole, it might bring me luck;         and there seems but one objection;     which is, if you'll let me speak so bold,     your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,         and would probably give me the roo-         matiz, said the kangaroo.                                       iv.      said the duck, as i sate on the rocks,         i have thought over that completely;     and i bought four pairs of worsted socks,         which fit my web-feet neatly;     and, to keep out the cold, i've bought a cloak;     and every day a cigar i'll smoke;         all to follow my own dear true         love of a kangaroo.                       v.      said the kangaroo, i'm ready,         all in the moonlight pale;     but to balance me well, dear duck, sit steady,         and quite at the end of my tail.     so away they went with a hop and a bound;     and they hopped the whole world three times round.         and who so happy, oh! who,         as the duck and the kangaroo?                    the daddy long-legs and the fly.                        i.      once mr. daddy long-legs,         dressed in brown and gray,     walked about upon the sands         upon a summer's day:     and there among the pebbles,         when the wind was rather cold,     he met with mr. floppy fly,         all dressed in blue and gold;     and, as it was too soon to dine,     they drank some periwinkle-wine,     and played an hour or two, or more,     at battlecock and shuttledore.                       ii.      said mr. daddy long-legs         to mr. floppy fly,     why do you never come to court?         i wish you 'd tell me why.     all gold and shine, in dress so fine,         you'd quite delight the court.     why do you never go at all?         i really think you ought.     and, if you went, you'd see such sights!     such rugs and jugs and candle-lights!     and, more than all, the king and queen,--     one in red, and one in green.                       iii.      o mr. daddy long-legs!         said mr. floppy fly,     it's true i never go to court;         and i will tell you why.     if i had six long legs like yours,         at once i'd go to court;     but, oh! i can't, because my legs         are so extremely short.     and i'm afraid the king and queen     (one in red, and one in green)     would say aloud, 'you are not fit,     you fly, to come to court a bit!'                       iv.      oh, mr. daddy long-legs!         said mr. floppy fly,     i wish you 'd sing one little song,         one mumbian melody.     you used to sing so awful well         in former days gone by;     but now you never sing at all:         i wish you'd tell me why:     for, if you would, the silvery sound     would please the shrimps and cockles round,     and all the crabs would gladly come     to hear you sing, 'ah, hum di hum!'                       v.      said mr. daddy long-legs,        i can never sing again;     and, if you wish, i'll tell you why,         although it gives me pain.     for years i cannot hum a bit,         or sing the smallest song;     and this the dreadful reason is,--         my legs are grown too long!     my six long legs, all here and there,     oppress my bosom with despair;     and, if i stand or lie or sit,     i cannot sing one single bit!                       vi.      so mr. daddy long-legs         and mr. floppy fly     sat down in silence by the sea,         and gazed upon the sky.     they said, this is a dreadful thing!         the world has all gone wrong,     since one has legs too short by half,         the other much too long.     one never more can go to court,     because his legs have grown too short;     the other cannot sing a song,     because his legs have grown too long!                       vii.      then mr. daddy long-legs         and mr. floppy fly     rushed downward to the foamy sea         with one sponge-taneous cry:     and there they found a little boat,         whose sails were pink and gray;     and off they sailed among the waves,         far and far away:     they sailed across the silent main,     and reached the great gromboolian plain;     and there they play forevermore     at battlecock and shuttledore.       the jumblies.                        i.      they went to sea in a sieve, they did;         in a sieve they went to sea:     in spite of all their friends could say,     on a winter's morn, on a stormy day,         in a sieve they went to sea.     and when the sieve turned round and round,     and every one cried, you'll all be drowned!     they called aloud, our sieve ain't big;     but we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:         in a sieve we'll go to sea!              far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:              their heads are green, and their hands are blue         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        ii.      they sailed away in a sieve, they did,         in a sieve they sailed so fast,     with only a beautiful pea-green veil     tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,         to a small tobacco-pipe mast.     and every one said who saw them go,    oh! won't they be soon upset, you know?     for the sky is dark, and the voyage is long;     and, happen what may, it's extremely wrong         in a sieve to sail so fast.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        iii.      the water it soon came in, it did;         the water it soon came in:     so, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet         in a pinky paper all folded neat;     and they fastened it down with a pin.     and they passed the night in a crockery-jar;     and each of them said, how wise we are!     though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,     yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,         while round in our sieve we spin.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        iv.      and all night long they sailed away;         and when the sun went down,     they whistled and warbled a moony song         to the echoing sound of a coppery gong,     in the shade of the mountains brown.    o timballoo! how happy we are     when we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!     and all night long, in the moonlight pale,     we sail away with a pea-green sail         in the shade of the mountains brown.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        v.      they sailed to the western sea, they did,--         to a land all covered with trees:     and they bought an owl, and a useful cart,         and a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,     and a hive of silvery bees;     and they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,     and a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,     and forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,         and no end of stilton cheese.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        vi.      and in twenty years they all came back,--         in twenty years or more;     and every one said, how tall they've grown!         for they've been to the lakes, and the torrible zone,     and the hills of the chankly bore.     and they drank their health, and gave them a feast     of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;     and every one said, if we only live,     we, too, will go to sea in a sieve,         to the hills of the chankly bore.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.     the nutcrackers and the sugar-tongs.                         i.      the nutcrackers sate by a plate on the table;         the sugar-tongs sate by a plate at his side;     and the nutcrackers said, don't you wish we were able         along the blue hills and green meadows to ride?     must we drag on this stupid existence forever,         so idle and weary, so full of remorse,     while every one else takes his pleasure, and never         seems happy unless he is riding a horse?                        ii.      don't you think we could ride without being instructed,         without any saddle or bridle or spur?     our legs are so long, and so aptly constructed,         i'm sure that an accident could not occur.     let us all of a sudden hop down from the table,         and hustle downstairs, and each jump on a horse!     shall we try? shall we go? do you think we are able?         the sugar-tongs answered distinctly, of course!                        iii.      so down the long staircase they hopped in a minute;         the sugar-tongs snapped, and the crackers said crack!     the stable was open; the horses were in it:         each took out a pony, and jumped on his back.     the cat in a fright scrambled out of the doorway;         the mice tumbled out of a bundle of hay;     the brown and white rats, and the black ones from norway,         screamed out, they are taking the horses away!                        iv.      the whole of the household was filled with amazement:         the cups and the saucers danced madly about;     the plates and the dishes looked out of the casement;         the salt-cellar stood on his head with a shout;     the spoons, with a clatter, looked out of the lattice;         the mustard-pot climbed up the gooseberry-pies;     the soup-ladle peeped through a heap of veal-patties,         and squeaked with a ladle-like scream of surprise.                        v.      the frying-pan said, it's an awful delusion!         the tea-kettle hissed, and grew black in the face;     and they all rushed downstairs in the wildest confusion         to see the great nutcracker-sugar-tong race.     and out of the stable, with screamings and laughter         (their ponies were cream-colored, speckled with brown),     the nutcrackers first, and the sugar-tongs after;         rode all round the yard, and then all round the town.                        vi.      they rode through the street, and they rode by the station;         they galloped away to the beautiful shore;     in silence they rode, and made no observation,         save this: we will never go back any more!     and still you might hear, till they rode out of hearing,         the sugar-tongs snap, and the crackers say crack!     till, far in the distance their forms disappearing,         they faded away; and they never came back!     calico pie.                         i.        calico pie,       the little birds fly     down to the calico-tree:       their wings were blue,       and they sang tilly-loo!       till away they flew;         and they never came back to me!           they never came back,           they never came back,         they never came back to me!                        ii.        calico jam,       the little fish swam     over the syllabub sea.       he took off his hat       to the sole and the sprat,       and the willeby-wat:         but he never came back to me;           he never came back,           he never came back,         he never came back to me.                                         iii.        calico ban,       the little mice ran     to be ready in time for tea;       flippity flup,       they drank it all up,       and danced in the cup:         but they never came back to me;           they never came back,           they never came back,         they never came back to me.                                         iv.        calico drum,       the grasshoppers come,     the butterfly, beetle, and bee,       over the ground,       around and round,       with a hop and a bound;         but they never came back,           they never came back,           they never came back.         they never came back to me.                      mr. and mrs. spikky sparrow.                         i.      on a little piece of wood     mr. spikky sparrow stood:     mrs. sparrow sate close by,     a-making of an insect-pie     for her little children five,     in the nest and all alive;     singing with a cheerful smile,     to amuse them all the while,        twikky wikky wikky wee,         wikky bikky twikky tee,             spikky bikky bee!                        ii.      mrs. spikky sparrow said,     spikky, darling! in my head     many thoughts of trouble come,     like to flies upon a plum.     all last night, among the trees,     i heard you cough, i heard you sneeze;     and thought i, 'it's come to that     because he does not wear a hat!'         chippy wippy sikky tee,         bikky wikky tikky mee,             spikky chippy wee!                        iii.      not that you are growing old;     but the nights are growing cold.     no one stays out all night long     without a hat: i'm sure it's wrong!     mr. spikky said, how kind,     dear, you are, to speak your mind!     all your life i wish you luck!     you are, you are, a lovely duck!         witchy witchy witchy wee,         twitchy witchy witchy bee,             tikky tikky tee!                        iv.      i was also sad, and thinking,     when one day i saw you winking,     and i heard you sniffle-snuffle,     and i saw your feathers ruffle:     to myself i sadly said,     'she's neuralgia in her head!     that dear head has nothing on it!     ought she not to wear a bonnet?'         witchy kitchy kitchy wee,         spikky wikky mikky bee,             chippy wippy chee!                        v.      let us both fly up to town:     there i'll buy you such a gown!     which, completely in the fashion,     you shall tie a sky-blue sash on;     and a pair of slippers neat     to fit your darling little feet,     so that you will look and feel     quite galloobious and genteel.         jikky wikky bikky see,         chicky bikky wikky bee,             twicky witchy wee!                        vi.      so they both to london went,     alighting on the monument;     whence they flew down swiftly--pop!     into moses' wholesale shop:     there they bought a hat and bonnet,     and a gown with spots upon it,     a satin sash of cloxam blue,     and a pair of slippers too.         zikky wikky mikky bee,         witchy witchy mitchy kee,             sikky tikky wee!                        vii.      then, when so completely dressed,     back they flew, and reached their nest.     their children cried, o ma and pa!     how truly beautiful you are!     said they, we trust that cold or pain     we shall never feel again;     while, perched on tree or house or steeple,     we now shall look like other people.         witchy witchy witchy wee,         twikky mikky bikky bee,             zikky sikky tee!                      the broom, the shovel, the poker, and the tongs.                         i.      the broom and the shovel, the poker and tongs,       they all took a drive in the park;     and they each sang a song, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!       before they went back in the dark.     mr. poker he sate quite upright in the coach;       mr. tongs made a clatter and clash;     miss shovel was dressed all in black (with a brooch);       mrs. broom was in blue (with a sash).         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         and they all sang a song.                        ii.     o shovely so lovely! the poker he sang,      you have perfectly conquered my heart.     ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong! if you're pleased with my song,       i will feed you with cold apple-tart.     when you scrape up the coals with a delicate sound,       you enrapture my life with delight,     your nose is so shiny, your head is so round,       and your shape is so slender and bright!         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         ain't you pleased with my song?                        iii.     alas! mrs. broom, sighed the tongs in his song,      oh! is it because i'm so thin,     and my legs are so long,--ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!--       that you don't care about me a pin?     ah! fairest of creatures, when sweeping the room,       ah! why don't you heed my complaint?     must you needs be so cruel, you beautiful broom,       because you are covered with paint?         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         you are certainly wrong.                        iv.      mrs. broom and miss shovel together they sang,      what nonsense you're singing to-day!     said the shovel, i'll certainly hit you a bang!       said the broom, and i'll sweep you away!     so the coachman drove homeward as fast as he could,       perceiving their anger with pain;     but they put on the kettle, and little by little       they all became happy again.         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         there's an end of my song.     the table and the chair.                         i.      said the table to the chair,     you can hardly be aware     how i suffer from the heat     and from chilblains on my feet.     if we took a little walk,     we might have a little talk;     pray let us take the air,     said the table to the chair.                        ii.      said the chair unto the table,     now, you know we are not able:     how foolishly you talk,     when you know we cannot walk!     said the table with a sigh,     it can do no harm to try.     i've as many legs as you:     why can't we walk on two?                        iii.      so they both went slowly down,     and walked about the town     with a cheerful bumpy sound     as they toddled round and round;     and everybody cried,     as they hastened to their side,     see! the table and the chair     have come out to take the air!                        iv.      but in going down an alley,     to a castle in a valley,     they completely lost their way,     and wandered all the day;     till, to see them safely back,     they paid a ducky-quack,     and a beetle, and a mouse,     who took them to their house.                                        v.      then they whispered to each other,     o delightful little brother,     what a lovely walk we've taken!     let us dine on beans and bacon.     so the ducky and the leetle     browny-mousy and the beetle     dined, and danced upon their heads     till they toddled to their beds.                                                              nonsense stories.   the story of the four little children who went round the world.  once upon a time, a long while ago, there were four little people whose names were    violet, slingsby, guy, and lionel; and they all thought they should like to see the world. so they bought a large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, and then they were to come back on the other side by land. the boat was painted blue with green spots, and the sail was yellow with red stripes: and, when they set off, they only took a small cat to steer and look after the boat, besides an elderly quangle-wangle, who had to cook the dinner and make the tea; for which purposes they took a large kettle.    for the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and found plenty to eat, as there were lots of fish; and they had only to take them out of the sea with a long spoon, when the quangle-wangle instantly cooked them; and the pussy-cat was fed with the bones, with which she expressed herself pleased, on the whole: so that all the party were very happy.  during the daytime, violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt water into a churn; while her three brothers churned it violently, in the hope that it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did; and in the evening they all retired into the tea-kettle, where they all managed to sleep very comfortably, while pussy and the quangle-wangle managed the boat.    after a time, they saw some land at a distance; and, when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses, with a great gulf-stream running about all over it; so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.  when they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their great surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and chocolate-drops, and nothing else. so they all climbed up the single high tree to discover, if possible, if there were any people; but having remained on the top of the tree for a week, and not seeing anybody, they naturally concluded that there were no inhabitants; and accordingly, when they came down, they loaded the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets and a million of chocolate-drops; and these afforded them sustenance for more than a month, during which time they pursued their voyage with the utmost delight and apathy.    after this they came to a shore where there were no less than sixty-five great red parrots with blue tails, sitting on a rail all of a row, and all fast asleep. and i am sorry to say that the pussy-cat and the quangle-wangle crept softly, and bit off the tail-feathers of all the sixty-five parrots; for which violet reproved them both severely.    notwithstanding which, she proceeded to insert all the feathers--two hundred and sixty in number--in her bonnet; thereby causing it to have a lovely and glittering appearance, highly prepossessing and efficacious.    the next thing that happened to them was in a narrow part of the sea, which was so entirely full of fishes that the boat could go on no farther: so they remained there about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly all the fishes, which were soles, and all ready-cooked, and covered with shrimp-sauce, so that there was no trouble whatever. and as the few fishes who remained uneaten complained of the cold, as well as of the difficulty they had in getting any sleep on account of the extreme noise made by the arctic bears and the tropical turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood in great numbers, violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for several of the fishes, and slingsby administered some opium-drops to them; through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.    then they came to a country which was wholly covered with immense orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of fruit. so they all landed, taking with them the tea-kettle, intending to gather some of the oranges, and place them in it. but, while they were busy about this, a most dreadfully high wind rose, and blew out most of the parrot-tail feathers from violet's bonnet. that, however, was nothing compared with the calamity of the oranges falling down on their heads by millions and millions, which thumped and bumped and bumped and thumped them all so seriously, that they were obliged to run as hard as they could for their lives; besides that the sound of the oranges rattling on the tea-kettle was of the most fearful and amazing nature.    nevertheless, they got safely to the boat, although considerably vexed and hurt; and the quangle-wangle's right foot was so knocked about, that he had to sit with his head in his slipper for at least a week.    this event made them all for a time rather melancholy: and perhaps they might never have become less so, had not lionel, with a most praiseworthy devotion and perseverance, continued to stand on one leg, and whistle to them in a loud and lively manner; which diverted the whole party so extremely that they gradually recovered their spirits, and agreed that whenever they should reach home, they would subscribe towards a testimonial to lionel, entirely made of gingerbread and raspberries, as an earnest token of their sincere and grateful infection.    after sailing on calmly for several more days, they came to another country, where they were much pleased and surprised to see a countless multitude of white mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle, slowly eating custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite demeanor.    and as the four travellers were rather hungry, being tired of eating nothing but soles and oranges for so long a period, they held a council as to the propriety of asking the mice for some of their pudding in a humble and affecting manner, by which they could hardly be otherwise than gratified. it was agreed, therefore, that guy should go and ask the mice, which he immediately did; and the result was, that they gave a walnut-shell only half full of custard diluted with water. now, this displeased guy, who said, out of such a lot of pudding as you have got, i must say, you might have spared a somewhat larger quantity. but no sooner had he finished speaking than the mice turned round at once, and sneezed at him in an appalling and vindictive manner (and it is impossible to imagine a more scroobious and unpleasant sound than that caused by the simultaneous sneezing of many millions of angry mice); so that guy rushed back to the boat, having first shied his cap into the middle of the custard-pudding, by which means he completely spoiled the mice's dinner.    by and by the four children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. each of these blue bottles contained a blue-bottle-fly; and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony: nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. violet and slingsby and guy and lionel were greatly struck with this singular and instructive settlement; and, having previously asked permission of the blue-bottle-flies (which was most courteously granted), the boat was drawn up to the shore, and they proceeded to make tea in front of the bottles: but as they had no tea-leaves, they merely placed some pebbles in the hot water; and the quangle-wangle played some tunes over it on an accordion, by which, of course, tea was made directly, and of the very best quality.  the four children then entered into conversation with the blue-bottle-flies, who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they each held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally occasioned a fizzy, extraneous utterance.  why, said violet, would you kindly inform us, do you reside in bottles; and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple, or, indeed, in yellow bottles?  to which questions a very aged blue-bottle-fly answered, we found the bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our great-great-great- great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at once. and, when the winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside down, and consequently rarely feel the cold at all; and you know very well that this could not be the case with bottles of any other color than blue.  of course it could not, said slingsby. but, if we may take the liberty of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?  mainly on oyster-patties, said the blue-bottle-fly; and, when these are scarce, on raspberry vinegar and russian leather boiled down to a jelly.  how delicious! said guy.  to which lionel added, huzz! and all the blue-bottle-flies said, buzz!  at this time, an elderly fly said it was the hour for the evening-song to be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the blue-bottle-flies began to buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner, the melodious and mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters, and resounding across the tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice upon the intervening and verdant mountains with a serene and sickly suavity only known to the truly virtuous. the moon was shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky, while her light irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of the blue-bottle-flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous circumstances.  in many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to that evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was already past midnight when--the sail of the boat having been set up by the quangle-wangle, the tea-kettle and churn placed in their respective positions, and the pussy-cat stationed at the helm--the children each took a last and affectionate farewell of the blue-bottle-flies, who walked down in a body to the water's edge to see the travellers embark.    as a token of parting respect and esteem, violet made a courtesy quite down to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining parrot-tail feathers into the back hair of the most pleasing of the blue-bottle-flies; while slingsby, guy, and lionel offered them three small boxes, containing, respectively, black pins, dried figs, and epsom salts; and thus they left that happy shore forever.  overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly jumped into the tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. but all along the shore, for many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of severely-suppressed sobs, and of a vague multitude of living creatures using their pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous snuffle, lingering sadly along the walloping waves as the boat sailed farther and farther away from the land of the happy blue-bottle-flies.  nothing particular occurred for some days after these events, except that, as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they perceived an unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large number of crabs and crawfish--perhaps six or seven hundred--sitting by the water-side, and endeavoring to disentangle a vast heap of pale pink worsted, which they moistened at intervals with a fluid composed of lavender-water and white-wine negus.  can we be of any service to you, o crusty crabbies? said the four children.  thank you kindly, said the crabs consecutively. we are trying to make some worsted mittens, but do not know how.  on which violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of mitten-making, said to the crabs, do your claws unscrew, or are they fixtures?  they are all made to unscrew, said the crabs; and forthwith they deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which violet uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest mittens with it you can imagine. these the crabs, having resumed and screwed on their claws, placed cheerfully upon their wrists, and walked away rapidly on their hind-legs, warbling songs with a silvery voice and in a minor key.  after this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to a vast and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing whatever could be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked onward, there appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single object, which on a nearer approach, and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig, sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cakes and oyster-shells. it does not quite look like a human being, said violet doubtfully; nor could they make out what it really was, till the quangle-wangle (who had previously been round the world) exclaimed softly in a loud voice, it is the co-operative cauliflower!    and so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the cauliflower; and that he had no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk,--an accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense of stockings and shoes.  presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and, in a somewhat plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the setting sun,--his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers, and a large number of waterwagtails proceeding in advance of him by three and three in a row,--till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand.    so remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.  shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below some high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly odious little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers, and with a pewter plate upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin at the boat, by which it was instantly upset.    but this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party knew how to swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming about till after the moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they sponge-taneously entered the boat. meanwhile the quangle-wangle threw back the pumpkin with immense force, so that it hit the rocks where the malicious little boy in rose-colored knickerbockers was sitting; when, being quite full of lucifer-matches, the pumpkin exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits; whereon the rocks instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became unpleasantly hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were turned quite green, and his nose was burnt off.  two or three days after this had happened, they came to another place, where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep pits full of mulberry-jam. this is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed apes who abound in these districts, and who store up the mulberry-jam for their food in winter, when they mix it with pellucid pale periwinkle-soup, and serve it out in wedgewood china-bowls, which grow freely all over that part of the country. only one of the yellow-nosed apes was on the spot, and he was fast asleep; yet the four travellers and the quangle-wangle and pussy were so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring, that they merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned to re-embark in their boat without delay.  what was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn and the tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous seeze pyder, an aquatic and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and, happily, only met with in those excessive longitudes! in a moment, the beautiful boat was bitten into fifty-five thousand million hundred billion bits; and it instantly became quite clear that violet, slingsby, guy, and lionel could no longer preliminate their voyage by sea.  the four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing their wanderings by land: and, very fortunately, there happened to pass by at that moment an elderly rhinoceros, on which they seized; and, all four mounting on his back,--the quangle-wangle sitting on his horn, and holding on by his ears, and the pussy-cat swinging at the end of his tail,--they set off, having only four small beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes to last through their whole journey.    they were, however, able to catch numbers of the chickens and turkeys and other birds who incessantly alighted on the head of the rhinoceros for the purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew there; and these creatures they cooked in the most translucent and satisfactory manner by means of a fire lighted on the end of the rhinoceros's back. a crowd of kangaroos and gigantic cranes accompanied them, from feelings of curiosity and complacency; so that they were never at a loss for company, and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse and triumphant procession.  thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at home, where they were received by their admiring relatives with joy tempered with contempt, and where they finally resolved to carry out the rest of their travelling-plans at some more favorable opportunity.  as for the rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they had him killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside the door of their father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper.       the history of the seven families of the lake pipple-popple.   chapter i.  introductory.  in former days,--that is to say, once upon a time,--there lived in the land of gramble-blamble seven families. they lived by the side of the great lake pipple-popple (one of the seven families, indeed, lived in the lake), and on the outskirts of the city of tosh, which, excepting when it was quite dark, they could see plainly. the names of all these places you have probably heard of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to find out all about them.  now, the seven families who lived on the borders of the great lake pipple-popple were as follows in the next chapter.   chapter ii.  the seven families.  there was a family of two old parrots and seven young parrots.    there was a family of two old storks and seven young storks.    there was a family of two old geese and seven young geese.    there was a family of two old owls and seven young owls.    there was a family of two old guinea pigs and seven young guinea pigs.    there was a family of two old cats and seven young cats.    and there was a family of two old fishes and seven young fishes.     chapter iii.  the habits of the seven families.  the parrots lived upon the soffsky-poffsky trees, which were beautiful to behold, and covered with blue leaves; and they fed upon fruit, artichokes, and striped beetles.  the storks walked in and out of the lake pipple-popple, and ate frogs for breakfast, and buttered toast for tea; but on account of the extreme length of their legs they could not sit down, and so they walked about continually.  the geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies, which they ate for dinner.  the owls anxiously looked after mice, which they caught, and made into sago-puddings.  the guinea pigs toddled about the gardens, and ate lettuces and cheshire cheese.  the cats sate still in the sunshine, and fed upon sponge biscuits.  the fishes lived in the lake, and fed chiefly on boiled periwinkles.  and all these seven families lived together in the utmost fun and felicity.   chapter iv.  the children of the seven families are sent away.  one day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the seven families agreed that they would send their children out to see the world.  so they called them all together, and gave them each eight shillings and some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small green morocco pocket-book to set down their expenses in.  they then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all the parents sent off their children with a parting injunction.  if, said the old parrots, you find a cherry, do not fight about who should have it.  and, said the old storks, if you find a frog, divide it carefully into seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it.  and the old geese said to the seven young geese, whatever you do, be sure you do not touch a plum-pudding flea.  and the old owls said, if you find a mouse, tear him up into seven slices, and eat him cheerfully, but without quarrelling.  and the old guinea pigs said, have a care that you eat your lettuces, should you find any, not greedily, but calmly.  and the old cats said, be particularly careful not to meddle with a clangle-wangle if you should see one.  and the old fishes said, above all things, avoid eating a blue boss-woss; for they do not agree with fishes, and give them a pain in their toes.  so all the children of each family thanked their parents; and, making in all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide world.    chapter v.  the history of the seven young parrots.  the seven young parrots had not gone far, when they saw a tree with a single cherry on it, which the oldest parrot picked instantly; but the other six, being extremely hungry, tried to get it also. on which all the seven began to fight; and they scuffled,      and huffled,        and ruffled,          and shuffled,            and puffled,              and muffled,                and buffled,                  and duffled,                    and fluffled,                      and guffled,                        and bruffled,                          and screamed, and shrieked, and squealed, and squeaked, and clawed, and snapped, and bit, and bumped, and thumped, and dumped, and flumped each other, till they were all torn into little bits; and at last there was nothing left to record this painful incident except the cherry and seven small green feathers.  and that was the vicious and voluble end of the seven young parrots.     chapter vi.  the history of the seven young storks.  when the seven young storks set out, they walked or flew for fourteen weeks in a straight line, and for six weeks more in a crooked one; and after that they ran as hard as they could for one hundred and eight miles; and after that they stood still, and made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery noise with their bills.  about the same time they perceived a large frog, spotted with green, and with a sky-blue stripe under each ear.  so, being hungry, they immediately flew at him, and were going to divide him into seven pieces, when they began to quarrel as to which of his legs should be taken off first. one said this, and another said that; and while they were all quarrelling, the frog hopped away. and when they saw that he was gone, they began to   chatter-clatter,       blatter-platter,           patter-blatter,               matter-clatter,                   flatter-quatter, more violently than ever; and after they had fought for a week, they pecked each other all to little pieces, so that at last nothing was left of any of them except their bills.  and that was the end of the seven young storks.     chapter vii.  the history of the seven young geese.  when the seven young geese began to travel, they went over a large plain, on which there was but one tree, and that was, a very bad one.  so four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about them; while the other three waddled up and down, and repeated poetry, and their last six lessons in arithmetic, geography, and cookery.  presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most interesting and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body exactly resembling a boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and a beak, and three feathers growing out of his head, and only one leg.  so, after a time, all the seven young geese said to each other, beyond all doubt this beast must be a plum-pudding flea!  on which they incautiously began to sing aloud,         plum-pudding flea,         plum-pudding flea,         wherever you be,         oh! come to our tree,     and listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!  and no sooner had they sung this verse than the plum-pudding flea began to hop and skip on his one leg with the most dreadful velocity, and came straight to the tree, where he stopped, and looked about him in a vacant and voluminous manner.  on which the seven young geese were greatly alarmed, and all of a tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and just touched him with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he done this than the plum-pudding flea skipped and hopped about more and more, and higher and higher; after which he opened his mouth, and, to the great surprise and indignation of the seven geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and terribly, that they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees every one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.  so that was the end of the seven young geese.     chapter viii.  the history of the seven young owls.  when the seven young owls set out, they sate every now and then on the branches of old trees, and never went far at one time.  and one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard a mouse; but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not see him.  so they called out, is that a mouse?  on which a mouse answered, squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!  and immediately all the young owls threw themselves off the tree, meaning to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive that there was a large well below them, into which they all fell superficially, and were every one of them drowned in less than half a minute.  so that was the end of the seven young owls.     chapter ix.  the history of the seven young guinea pigs.  the seven young guinea pigs went into a garden full of goose-berry-bushes and tiggory-trees, under one of which they fell asleep. when they awoke, they saw a large lettuce, which had grown out of the ground while they had been sleeping, and which had an immense number of green leaves. at which they all exclaimed,--     lettuce! o lettuce     let us, o let us,     o lettuce-leaves,     o let us leave this tree, and eat     lettuce, o let us, lettuce-leaves!  and instantly the seven young guinea pigs rushed with such extreme force against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly against its stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient transitional inflammation of their noses, which grew worse and worse and worse and worse, till it incidentally killed them all seven.  and that was the end of the seven young guinea pigs.     chapter x.  the history of the seven young cats.  the seven young cats set off on their travels with great delight and rapacity. but, on coming to the top of a high hill, they perceived at a long distance off a clangle-wangle (or, as it is more properly written, clangel-wangel); and, in spite of the warning they had had, they ran straight up to it.  (now, the clangle-wangle is a most dangerous and delusive beast, and by no means commonly to be met with. they live in the water as well as on land, using their long tail as a sail when in the former element. their speed is extreme; but their habits of life are domestic and superfluous, and their general demeanor pensive and pellucid. on summer evenings, they may sometimes be observed near the lake pipple-popple, standing on their heads, and humming their national melodies. they subsist entirely on vegetables, excepting when they eat veal or mutton or pork or beef or fish or saltpetre.)  the moment the clangle-wangle saw the seven young cats approach, he ran away; and as he ran straight on for four months, and the cats, though they continued to run, could never overtake him, they all gradually died of fatigue and exhaustion, and never afterwards recovered.  and this was the end of the seven young cats.     chapter xi.  the history of the seven young fishes.  the seven young fishes swam across the lake pipple-popple, and into the river, and into the ocean; where, most unhappily for them, they saw, on the fifteenth day of their travels, a bright-blue boss-woss, and instantly swam after him. but the blue boss-woss plunged into a     perpendicular,         spicular,             orbicular,                 quadrangular,                      circular depth of soft mud; where, in fact, his house was.  and the seven young fishes, swimming with great and uncomfortable velocity, plunged also into the mud quite against their will, and, not being accustomed to it, were all suffocated in a very short period.  and that was the end of the seven young fishes.     chapter xii.  of what occurred subsequently.  after it was known that the              seven young parrots,     and the seven young storks,     and the seven young geese,     and the seven young owls,     and the seven young guinea pigs,     and the seven young cats,     and the seven young fishes,  were all dead, then the frog, and the plum-pudding flea, and the mouse, and the clangle-wangle, and the blue boss-woss, all met together to rejoice over their good fortune. and they collected the seven feathers of the seven young parrots, and the seven bills of the seven young storks, and the lettuce, and the cherry; and having placed the latter on the lettuce, and the other objects in a circular arrangement at their base, they danced a hornpipe round all these memorials until they were quite tired; after which they gave a tea-party, and a garden-party, and a ball, and a concert, and then returned to their respective homes full of joy and respect, sympathy, satisfaction, and disgust.     chapter xiii.  of what became of the parents of the forty-nine children.  but when the two old parrots,      and the two old storks,      and the two old geese,      and the two old owls,      and the two old guinea pigs,      and the two old cats,      and the two old fishes,  became aware, by reading in the newspapers, of the calamitous extinction of the whole of their families, they refused all further sustenance; and, sending out to various shops, they purchased great quantities of cayenne pepper and brandy and vinegar and blue sealing-wax, besides seven immense glass bottles with air-tight stoppers. and, having done this, they ate a light supper of brown-bread and jerusalem artichokes, and took an affecting and formal leave of the whole of their acquaintance, which was very numerous and distinguished and select and responsible and ridiculous.   chapter xiv.  conclusion.  and after this they filled the bottles with the ingredients for pickling, and each couple jumped into a separate bottle; by which effort, of course, they all died immediately, and became thoroughly pickled in a few minutes; having previously made their wills (by the assistance of the most eminent lawyers of the district), in which they left strict orders that the stoppers of the seven bottles should be carefully sealed up with the blue sealing-wax they had purchased; and that they themselves, in the bottles, should be presented to the principal museum of the city of tosh, to be labelled with parchment or any other anti-congenial succedaneum, and to be placed on a marble table with silver-gilt legs, for the daily inspection and contemplation, and for the perpetual benefit, of the pusillanimous public.  and if you ever happen to go to gramble-blamble, and visit that museum in the city of tosh, look for them on the ninety-eighth table in the four hundred and twenty-seventh room of the right-hand corridor of the left wing of the central quadrangle of that magnificent building; for, if you do not, you certainly will not see them.                                                                 nonsense cookery.  extract from the nonsense gazette, for august, 1870.  our readers will be interested in the following communications from our valued and learned contributor, prof. bosh, whose labors in the fields of culinary and botanical science are so well known to all the world. the first three articles richly merit to be added to the domestic cookery of every family: those which follow claim the attention of all botanists; and we are happy to be able, through dr. bosh's kindness, to present our readers with illustrations of his discoveries. all the new flowers are found in the valley of verrikwier, near the lake of oddgrow, and on the summit of the hill orfeltugg.    three receipts for domestic cookery.   to make an amblongus pie.  take 4 pounds (say 4-1/2 pounds) of fresh amblongusses, and put them in a small pipkin.  cover them with water, and boil them for 8 hours incessantly; after which add 2 pints of new milk, and proceed to boil for 4 hours more.  when you have ascertained that the amblongusses are quite soft, take them out, and place them in a wide pan, taking care to shake them well previously.  grate some nutmeg over the surface, and cover them carefully with powdered gingerbread, curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity of cayenne pepper.  remove the pan into the next room, and place it on the floor. bring it back again, and let it simmer for three-quarters of an hour. shake the pan violently till all the amblongusses have become of a pale purple color.  then, having prepared the paste, insert the whole carefully; adding at the same time a small pigeon, 2 slices of beef, 4 cauliflowers, and any number of oysters.  watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of salt from time to time.  serve up in a clean dish, and throw the whole out of window as fast as possible.   to make crumbobblious cutlets.  procure some strips of beef, and, having cut them into the smallest possible slices, proceed to cut them still smaller,--eight, or perhaps nine times.  when the whole is thus minced, brush it up hastily with a new clothes-brush, and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon or a soup-ladle.  place the whole in a saucepan, and remove it to a sunny place,--say the roof of the house, if free from sparrows or other birds,--and leave it there for about a week.  at the end of that time add a little lavender, some oil of almonds, and a few herring-bones; and then cover the whole with 4 gallons of clarified crumbobblious sauce, when it will be ready for use.  cut it into the shape of ordinary cutlets, and serve up in a clean table-cloth or dinner-napkin.   to make gosky patties.  take a pig three or four years of age, and tie him by the off hind-leg to a post. place 5 pounds of currants, 3 of sugar, 2 pecks of peas, 18 roast chestnuts, a candle, and 6 bushels of turnips, within his reach: if he eats these, constantly provide him with more.  then procure some cream, some slices of cheshire cheese, 4 quires of foolscap paper, and a packet of black pins. work the whole into a paste, and spread it out to dry on a sheet of clean brown waterproof linen.  when the paste is perfectly dry, but not before, proceed to beat the pig violently with the handle of a large broom. if he squeals, beat him again.  visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days, and ascertain if, at the end of that period, the whole is about to turn into gosky patties.  if it does not then, it never will; and in that case the pig may be let loose, and the whole process may be considered as finished.                                              nonsense botany.

 (the ladies looked puzzled, as indeed was i, the author.)  do you not know who is the writer of it? asked the gentleman.  the name is 'edward lear,' said one of the ladies.  ah! said the first speaker, so it is printed; but that is only a whim of the real author, the earl of derby. 'edward' is his christian name, and, as you may see, lear is only earl transposed.  but, said the lady, doubtingly, here is a dedication to the great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces of edward, thirteenth earl of derby, by the author, edward lear.  that, replied the other, is simply a piece of mystification; i am in a position to know that the whole book was composed and illustrated by lord derby himself. in fact, there is no such a person at all as edward lear.  yet, said the other lady, some friends of mine tell me they know mr. lear.  quite a mistake! completely a mistake! said the old gentleman, becoming rather angry at the contradiction; i am well aware of what i am saying: i can inform you, no such a person as 'edward lear' exists!  hitherto i had kept silence; but as my hat was, as well as my handkerchief and stick, largely marked inside with my name, and as i happened to have in my pocket several letters addressed to me, the temptation was too great to resist; so, flashing all these articles at once on my would-be extinguisher's attention, i speedily reduced him to silence.  the second volume of nonsense, commencing with the verses, the owl and the pussy-cat, was written at different times, and for different sets of children: the whole being collected in the course of last year, were then illustrated, and published in a single volume, by mr. r.j. bush, of 32 charing cross.  the contents of the third or present volume were made also at different intervals in the last two years.  long years ago, in days when much of my time was passed in a country house, where children and mirth abounded, the lines beginning, there was an old man of tobago, were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse lending itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures; and thenceforth the greater part of the original drawings and verses for the first book of nonsense were struck off with a pen, no assistance ever having been given me in any way but that of uproarious delight and welcome at the appearance of every new absurdity.  most of these drawings and rhymes were transferred to lithographic stones in the year 1846, and were then first published by mr. thomas mclean, of the haymarket. but that edition having been soon exhausted, and the call for the book of nonsense continuing, i added a considerable number of subjects to those previously-published, and having caused the whole to be carefully reproduced in woodcuts by messrs. dalzell, i disposed of the copyright to messrs. routledge and warne, by whom the volume was published in 1843.                                                               edward lear.  villa emily, san remo, august, 1871.                                              nonsense botany.

they only said, stuff!     you amazing old man on the humber!            there was an old man in a barge,     whose nose was exceedingly large;     but in fishing by night, it supported a light,     which helped that old man in a barge.            there was an old man of dunrose;     a parrot seized hold of his nose.     when he grew melancholy, they said, his name's polly,     which soothed that old man of dunrose.            there was an old man of toulouse     who purchased a new pair of shoes;     when they asked, are they pleasant? he said, not at present!     that turbid old man of toulouse.            there was an old person of bree,     who frequented the depths of the sea;     she nurs'd the small fishes, and washed all the dishes,     and swam back again into bree.            there was an old person of bromley,     whose ways were not cheerful or comely;     he sate in the dust, eating spiders and crust,     that unpleasing old person of bromley.            there was an old person of shields,     who frequented the vallies and fields;     all the mice and the cats, and the snakes and the rats,     followed after that person of shields.            there was an old man of dunluce,     who went out to sea on a goose:     when he'd gone out a mile, he observ'd with a smile,     it is time to return to dunluce.            there was an old man of dee-side     whose hat was exceedingly wide,     but he said, do not fail, if it happen to hail,     to come under my hat at dee-side!

the dong!       the wandering dong through the forest goes!         the dong! the dong!       the dong with a luminous nose!          long years ago       the dong was happy and gay,     till he fell in love with a jumbly girl       who came to those shores one day.     for the jumblies came in a sieve, they did,--     landing at eve near the zemmery fidd         where the oblong oysters grow,       and the rocks are smooth and gray.     and all the woods and the valleys rang     with the chorus they daily and nightly sang,--         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live;           their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.      happily, happily passed those days!       while the cheerful jumblies staid;         they danced in circlets all night long,         to the plaintive pipe of the lively dong,       in moonlight, shine, or shade.     for day and night he was always there     by the side of the jumbly girl so fair,     with her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;     till the morning came of that hateful day     when the jumblies sailed in their sieve away,     and the dong was left on the cruel shore     gazing, gazing for evermore,--     ever keeping his weary eyes on     that pea-green sail on the far horizon,--     singing the jumbly chorus still     as he sate all day on the grassy hill,--         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live;           their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.      but when the sun was low in the west,         the dong arose and said,--     what little sense i once possessed         has quite gone out of my head!     and since that day he wanders still     by lake and forest, marsh and hill,     singing, o somewhere, in valley or plain,     might i find my jumbly girl again!     for ever i'll seek by lake and shore     till i find my jumbly girl once more!          playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,         since then his jumbly girl he seeks;         and because by night he could not see,         he gathered the bark of the twangum tree           on the flowery plain that grows.           and he wove him a wondrous nose,--         a nose as strange as a nose could be!      of vast proportions and painted red,     and tied with cords to the back of his head.         in a hollow rounded space it ended         with a luminous lamp within suspended,             all fenced about             with a bandage stout             to prevent the wind from blowing it out;         and with holes all round to send the light         in gleaming rays on the dismal night      and now each night, and all night long,     over those plains still roams the dong;     and above the wail of the chimp and snipe     you may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,     while ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,     to meet with his jumbly girl again;     lonely and wild, all night he goes,--     the dong with a luminous nose!     and all who watch at the midnight hour,     from hall or terrace or lofty tower,     cry, as they trace the meteor bright,     moving along through the dreary night,--        this is the hour when forth he goes,         the dong with a luminous nose!         yonder, over the plain he goes,--             he goes!             he goes,--         the dong with a luminous nose!     the two old bachelors.    two old bachelors were living in one house; one caught a muffin, the other caught a mouse. said he who caught the muffin to him who caught the mouse,-- this happens just in time! for we've nothing in the house, save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey, and what to do for dinner--since we haven't any money? and what can we expect if we haven't any dinner, but to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?  said he who caught the mouse to him who caught the muffin,-- we might cook this little mouse, if we only had some stuffin'! if we had but sage and onion we could do extremely well; but how to get that stuffin' it is difficult to tell!  those two old bachelors ran quickly to the town and asked for sage and onion as they wandered up and down; they borrowed two large onions, but no sage was to be found in the shops, or in the market, or in all the gardens round.  but some one said, a hill there is, a little to the north, and to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth; and there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient sage,-- an earnest man, who reads all day a most perplexing page. climb up, and seize him by the toes,--all studious as he sits,-- and pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits! then mix him with your onion (cut up likewise into scraps),-- when your stuffin' will be ready, and very good--perhaps.  those two old bachelors without loss of time the nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb; and at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook, they saw that sage a-reading of a most enormous book.  you earnest sage! aloud they cried, your book you've read enough in! we wish to chop you into bits to mix you into stuffin'!  but that old sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book, at those two bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took; and over crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,-- at once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town; and when they reached their house, they found (besides their want                                                           of stuffin'), the mouse had fled--and, previously, had eaten up the muffin.  they left their home in silence by the once convivial door; and from that hour those bachelors were never heard of more.   [illustration: sheet music--the pelicans]      the pelican chorus.      king and queen of the pelicans we;      no other birds so grand we see!     none but we have feet like fins!     with lovely leathery throats and chins!         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still      we live on the nile. the nile we love.     by night we sleep on the cliffs above;     by day we fish, and at eve we stand     on long bare islands of yellow sand.     and when the sun sinks slowly down,     and the great rock walls grow dark and brown,      where the purple river rolls fast and dim     and the ivory ibis starlike skim,     wing to wing we dance around,     stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,     opening our mouths as pelicans ought;     and this is the song we nightly snort,--         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      last year came out our daughter dell,     and all the birds received her well.     to do her honor a feast we made     for every bird that can swim or wade,--     herons and gulls, and cormorants black,     cranes, and flamingoes with scarlet back,     plovers and storks, and geese in clouds,     swans and dilberry ducks in crowds:     thousands of birds in wondrous flight!     they ate and drank and danced all night,     and echoing back from the rocks you heard     multitude-echoes from bird and bird,--         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      yes, they came; and among the rest     the king of the cranes all grandly dressed.     such a lovely tail! its feathers float     between the ends of his blue dress-coat;     with pea-green trowsers all so neat,     and a delicate frill to hide his feet     (for though no one speaks of it, every one knows     he has got no webs between his toes).      as soon as he saw our daughter dell,     in violent love that crane king fell,--     on seeing her waddling form so fair,     with a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.     and before the end of the next long day     our dell had given her heart away;     for the king of the cranes had won that heart     with a crocodile's egg and a large fish-tart.     she vowed to marry the king of the cranes,     leaving the nile for stranger plains;     and away they flew in a gathering crowd     of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      and far away in the twilight sky     we heard them singing a lessening cry,--     farther and farther, till out of sight,     and we stood alone in the silent night!     often since, in the nights of june,     we sit on the sand and watch the moon,--      she has gone to the great gromboolian plain,     and we probably never shall meet again!     oft, in the long still nights of june,     we sit on the rocks and watch the moon,--     she dwells by the streams of the chankly bore.     and we probably never shall see her more.         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!

(here she twirled her fingers madly,)          but in england i've a mate!           yes! you've asked me far too late,           for in england i've a mate,       mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!       mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!                       vi.     mr. jones (his name is handel,--          handel jones, esquire, & co.)            dorking fowls delights to send,        mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!     keep, oh, keep your chairs and candle,     and your jug without a handle,--           i can merely be your friend!           should my jones more dorkings send,           i will give you three, my friend!       mr. yonghy-bongy-b\\u00f2!       mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!                       vii.     though you've such a tiny body,          and your head so large doth grow,--            though your hat may blow away,        mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!     though you're such a hoddy doddy,     yet i wish that i could modi-           fy the words i needs must say!           will you please to go away?           that is all i have to say,       mr. yongby-bonghy-b\\u00f2!       mr. yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2!                       viii.      down the slippery slopes of myrtle,         where the early pumpkins blow,           to the calm and silent sea        fled the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.     there, beyond the bay of gurtle,     lay a large and lively turtle.          you're the cove, he said, for me;           on your back beyond the sea,           turtle, you shall carry me!       said the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2,       said the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.                                       ix.      through the silent-roaring ocean         did the turtle swiftly go;           holding fast upon his shell       rode the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.     with a sad primaeval motion     towards the sunset isles of boshen           still the turtle bore him well.           holding fast upon his shell,          lady jingly jones, farewell!       sang the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2,       sang the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.                       x.      from the coast of coromandel         did that lady never go;           on that heap of stones she mourns       for the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.     on that coast of coromandel,     in his jug without a handle         still she weeps, and daily moans;         on that little heap of stones         to her dorking hens she moans,           for the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2,           for the yonghy-bonghy-b\\u00f2.     the pobble who has no toes.                        i.      the pobble who has no toes         had once as many as we;     when they said, some day you may lose them all;         he replied, fish fiddle de-dee!     and his aunt jobiska made him drink     lavender water tinged with pink;     for she said, the world in general knows     there's nothing so good for a pobble's toes!                       ii.      the pobble who has no toes,         swam across the bristol channel;     but before he set out he wrapped his nose         in a piece of scarlet flannel.     for his aunt jobiska said, no harm     can come to his toes if his nose is warm;     and it's perfectly known that a pobble's toes     are safe--provided he minds his nose.                       iii.      the pobble swam fast and well,         and when boats or ships came near him,     he tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell         so that all the world could hear him.     and all the sailors and admirals cried,     when they saw him nearing the further side,--    he has gone to fish, for his aunt jobiska's     runcible cat with crimson whiskers!                       iv.      but before he touched the shore,--         the shore of the bristol channel,     a sea-green porpoise carried away         his wrapper of scarlet flannel.     and when he came to observe his feet,     formerly garnished with toes so neat,     his face at once became forlorn     on perceiving that all his toes were gone!                       v.      and nobody ever knew,         from that dark day to the present,     whoso had taken the pobble's toes,         in a manner so far from pleasant.     whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,     or crafty mermaids stole them away,     nobody knew; and nobody knows     how the pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!                       vi.      the pobble who has no toes         was placed in a friendly bark,     and they rowed him back, and carried him up         to his aunt jobiska's park.     and she made him a feast, at his earnest wish,     of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;     and she said, it's a fact the whole world knows,     that pobbles are happier without their toes.     the new vestments.      there lived an old man in the kingdom of tess,     who invented a purely original dress;     and when it was perfectly made and complete,     he opened the door and walked into the street.      by way of a hat he'd a loaf of brown bread,     in the middle of which he inserted his head;     his shirt was made up of no end of dead mice,     the warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;     his drawers were of rabbit-skins, so were his shoes;     his stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;     his waistcoat and trowsers were made of pork chops;     his buttons were jujubes and chocolate drops;     his coat was all pancakes, with jam for a border,     and a girdle of biscuits to keep it in order;     and he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,     a cloak of green cabbage-leaves stitched all together.      he had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,     of all sorts of beasticles, birdlings, and boys;     and from every long street and dark lane in the town     beasts, birdies, and boys in a tumult rushed down.     two cows and a calf ate his cabbage-leaf cloak;     four apes seized his girdle, which vanished like smoke;     three kids ate up half of his pancaky coat,     and the tails were devour'd by an ancient he goat;     an army of dogs in a twinkling tore up his     pork waistcoat and trowsers to give to their puppies;     and while they were growling, and mumbling the chops,     ten boys prigged the jujubes and chocolate drops.     he tried to run back to his house, but in vain,     for scores of fat pigs came again and again:     they rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;     they tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;     and now from the housetops with screechings descend     striped, spotted, white, black, and gray cats without end:     they jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,     when crows, ducks, and hens made a mincemeat of that;     they speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,     and utterly tore up his shirt of dead mice;     they swallowed the last of his shirt with a squall,--     whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.      and he said to himself, as he bolted the door,    i will not wear a similar dress any more,     any more, any more, any more, never more!     mr. and mrs. discobbolos.                      i.      mr. and mrs. discobbolos         climbed to the top of a wall.       and they sate to watch the sunset sky,       and to hear the nupiter piffkin cry,         and the biscuit buffalo call.     they took up a roll and some camomile tea,     and both were as happy as happy could be,             till mrs. discobbolos said,--            oh! w! x! y! z!             it has just come into my head,       suppose we should happen to fall!!!!!                         darling mr. discobbolos!                       ii.     suppose we should fall down flumpetty,         just like pieces of stone,       on to the thorns, or into the moat,       what would become of your new green coat?         and might you not break a bone?     it never occurred to me before,     that perhaps we shall never go down any more!             and mrs. discobbolos said,            oh! w! x! y! z!             what put it into your head       to climb up this wall, my own                         darling mr. discobbolos?                       iii.      mr. discobbolos answered,        at first it gave me pain,       and i felt my ears turn perfectly pink       when your exclamation made me think         we might never get down again!     but now i believe it is wiser far     to remain for ever just where we are.             and mr. discobbolos said,            oh! w! x! y! z!             it has just come into my head       we shall never go down again,                         dearest mrs. discobbolos!                       iv.      so mr. and mrs. discobbolos         stood up and began to sing,--      far away from hurry and strife       here we will pass the rest of life,         ding a dong, ding dong, ding!     we want no knives nor forks nor chairs,     no tables nor carpets nor household cares;             from worry of life we've fled;             oh! w! x! y! z!             there is no more trouble ahead,       sorrow or any such thing,                         for mr. and mrs. discobbolos!     the quangle wangle's hat.                        i.      on the top of the crumpetty tree         the quangle wangle sat,     but his face you could not see,         on account of his beaver hat.     for his hat was a hundred and two feet wide,     with ribbons and bibbons on every side,     and bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,     so that nobody ever could see the face             of the quangle wangle quee.                       ii.      the quangle wangle said         to himself on the crumpetty tree,     jam, and jelly, and bread         are the best of food for me!     but the longer i live on this crumpetty tree     the plainer than ever it seems to me     that very few people come this way     and that life on the whole is far from gay!             said the quangle wangle quee.                       iii.      but there came to the crumpetty tree         mr. and mrs. canary;     and they said, did ever you see         any spot so charmingly airy?     may we build a nest on your lovely hat?     mr. quangle wangle, grant us that!     o please let us come and build a nest     of whatever material suits you best,             mr. quangle wangle quee!                       iv.      and besides, to the crumpetty tree         came the stork, the duck, and the owl;     the snail and the bumble-bee,         the frog and the fimble fowl     (the fimble fowl, with a corkscrew leg);     and all of them said, we humbly beg     we may build our homes on your lovely hat,--     mr. quangle wangle, grant us that!        mr. quangle wangle quee!                       v.      and the golden grouse came there,         and the pobble who has no toes,     and the small olympian bear,         and the dong with a luminous nose.     and the blue baboon who played the flute,     and the orient calf from the land of tute,     and the attery squash, and the bisky bat,--     all came and built on the lovely hat       of the quangle wangle quee.                      vi.      and the quangle wangle said         to himself on the crumpetty tree,     when all these creatures move         what a wonderful noise there'll be!     and at night by the light of the mulberry moon     they danced to the flute of the blue baboon,     on the broad green leaves of the crumpetty tree,     and all were as happy as happy could be,       with the quangle wangle quee.     the cummerbund. an indian poem.                      i.  she sate upon her dobie,     to watch the evening star, and all the punkahs, as they passed,     cried, my! how fair you are! around her bower, with quivering leaves,     the tall kamsamahs grew, and kitmutgars in wild festoons     hung down from tchokis blue.                       ii.  below her home the river rolled     with soft meloobious sound, where golden-finned chuprassies swam,     in myriads circling round. above, on tallest trees remote     green ayahs perched alone, and all night long the mussak moan'd     its melancholy tone.                       iii.  and where the purple nullahs threw     their branches far and wide, and silvery goreewallahs flew     in silence, side by side, the little bheesties' twittering cry     rose on the flagrant air, and oft the angry jampan howled     deep in his hateful lair.                       iv.  she sate upon her dobie,     she heard the nimmak hum, when all at once a cry arose,     the cummerbund is come!

 eggs and butter and cake, mr. wolf.  where are you going with them, little red riding hood?  i am going to my grandmother, who is ill, mr. wolf.  where does your grandmother live, little red riding hood?  along that path, past the wild rose bushes, then through the gate at the end of the wood, mr. wolf.  then mr. wolf again said good morning and set off, and little red riding hood again went in search of wild flowers.  at last he reached the porch covered with flowers and knocked at the door of the cottage.  who is there? called the grandmother.  little red riding hood, said the wicked wolf.  press the latch, open the door, and walk in, said the grandmother.  the wolf pressed the latch, and walked in where the grandmother lay in bed. he made one jump at her, but she jumped out of bed into a closet. then the wolf put on the cap which she had dropped and crept under the bedclothes.  in a short while little red riding hood knocked at the door, and walked in, saying, good morning, grandmother, i have brought you eggs, butter and cake, and here is a bunch of flowers i gathered in the wood. as she came nearer the bed she said, what big ears you have, grandmother.  all the better to hear you with, my dear.  what big eyes you have, grandmother.  all the better to see you with, my dear.  but, grandmother, what a big nose you have.  all the better to smell with, my dear.  but, grandmother, what a big mouth you have.  all the better to eat you up with, my dear, he said as he sprang at little red riding hood.  just at that moment little red riding hood's father was passing the cottage and heard her scream. he rushed in and with his axe chopped off mr. wolf's head.  everybody was happy that little red riding hood had escaped the wolf. then little red riding hood's father carried her home and they lived happily ever after.     the goose-girl   there was once an old queen who had a very beautiful daughter. the time came when the maiden was to go into a distant country to be married. the old queen packed up everything suitable to a royal outfit.  she also sent a waiting-woman with her. when the hour of departure came they bade each other a sorrowful farewell and set out for the bridegroom's country.  when they had ridden for a time the princess became very thirsty, and said to the waiting-woman, go down and fetch me some water in my cup from the stream. i must have something to drink.  if you are thirsty, said the waiting-woman, dismount yourself, lie down by the water and drink. i don't choose to be your servant.  being very thirsty, the princess dismounted, and knelt by the flowing water.  now, when she was about to mount her horse again, the waiting-woman said, by rights your horse belongs to me; this jade will do for you!  the poor little princess was obliged to give way. then the waiting-woman, in a harsh voice, ordered her to take off her royal robes, and to put on her own mean garments. finally she forced her to swear that she would not tell a person at the court what had taken place. had she not taken the oath she would have been killed on the spot.  there was great rejoicing when they arrived at the castle. the prince hurried towards them, and lifted the waiting-woman from her horse, thinking she was his bride. she was led upstairs, but the real princess had to stay below.  the old king looked out of the window and saw the delicate, pretty little creature standing in the courtyard; so he asked the bride about her companion.  i picked her up on the way, and brought her with me for company. give the girl something to do to keep her from idling.  the old king said, i have a little lad who looks after the geese; she may help him.  the boy was called little conrad, and the real bride was sent with him to look after the geese. when they reached the meadow, the princess sat down on the grass and let down her hair, and when conrad saw it he was so delighted that he wanted to pluck some out; but she said--    blow, blow, little breeze,   and conrad's hat seize.   let him join in the chase   while away it is whirled,   till my tresses are curled   and i rest in my place.  then a strong wind sprang up, which blew away conrad's hat right over the fields, and he had to run after it. when he came back her hair was all put up again.  when they got home conrad went to the king and said, i won't tend the geese with that maiden again.  why not? asked the king.  then conrad went on to tell the king all that had happened in the field. the king ordered conrad to go next day as usual and he followed into the field and hid behind a bush. he saw it happen just as conrad had told him. thereupon he went away unnoticed; and in the evening, when the goose-girl came home, he asked her why she did all these things.  that i may not tell you, she answered.  then he said, if you won't tell me, then tell the iron stove there; and he went away.  she crept up to the stove and unburdened her heart to it. the king stood outside by the pipes of the stove and heard all she said. then he came back, and caused royal robes to be put upon her, and her beauty was a marvel. then he called his son and told him that he had a false bride, but that the true bride was here.  the prince was charmed with her beauty and a great banquet was prepared. the bridegroom sat at the head of the table, with the princess on one side and the waiting-woman at the other; but she did not recognize the princess.  when they had eaten, the king put a riddle to the waiting-woman. what does a person deserve that deceives his master? telling the whole story.  the false bride answered, he must be put into a barrel and dragged along by two white horses till he is dead.  that is your doom, said the king, and the judgment shall be carried out.  when the sentence was fulfilled, the young prince married his true bride, and they lived together in peace and happiness.     babes in the wood   once upon a time there lived two little children whose parents were ill unto death. they begged their brother to care for the two little ones as he would his own.  the uncle promised he would be a father to them, but he soon began to scheme to possess the money the parents had left in his care for the children. he sent for two robbers and bargained with them to take the two babes into the woods and kill them.  after going many miles into the woods one of the robbers said, let us not kill the little children, they never harmed us. the other robber would not consent, so they came to blows. this frightened the children so much that they ran away and did not see the robbers again.  they wandered on and on until they became so tired and hungry that at length they sat down at the foot of a tree and cried as if their hearts would break. the little birds heard them and began to trill sweet lullabies, which presently lulled them to rest.  the birdies knew that the children would die of cold and hunger, so they covered them with leaves of crimson and brown and green. they then told the angels in heaven the sad story of the lost babes, and one of the white-robed angels flew down to earth and carried both the little ones back to heaven, so that when they awoke they were no longer tired and hungry, but were again with their dear mother.     the sleeping beauty   once upon a time there was a king and queen who for a very long time had no children, and when at length a little daughter was born to them they were so pleased that they gave a christening feast to which they invited a number of fairies. but, unfortunately, they left out one rather cross old fairy, and she was so angry that she said the princess should die when she reached the age of sixteen, by pricking her hand with a spindle.  all the other fairies present, except one, had already given the princess their beautiful gifts, and this last one said she could not prevent part of the wicked wish coming true; but her gift should be that the princess should not really die, but only fall into a deep sleep, which should last for a hundred years, and at the end of that time she should be awakened by a king's son.  it all happened as the fairies had predicted. when the princess was sixteen years old she saw an old woman spinning and took the spindle from her to try this strange new work. instantly she pricked her hand and fell into a deep sleep, as did everyone else in the palace. there she lay in a bower of roses, year after year, and the hedge around the palace garden grew so tall and thick that at last you could not have told that there was a castle at all.  at the end of the hundred years a king's son heard of the castle and the enchanted princess who lay asleep there and determined to rescue her. so he cut his way through the thick prickly hedge and at length he came to the princess. when he saw how lovely and how sweet she looked he fell in love with her and, stooping, kissed her lips.  at once she awoke and with her the king and queen and all the courtiers, who had fallen asleep at the same time.  as the princess was as much taken with the prince's appearance as he was with hers, they decided to be married. and so the wedding was celebrated the same day with great pomp and ceremony.     snowdrop and seven little dwarfs   once upon a time there was a little princess called snowdrop, who had a cruel step-mother who was jealous of her. the queen had a magic mirror, which could speak to her, and when she looked into it and asked who was the fairest lady in the land the mirror told her she was, for she was very beautiful; but as snowdrop grew up she became still more lovely than her step-mother and the mirror did not fail to tell the queen this.  so she ordered one of her huntsmen to take snowdrop away and kill her; but he was too tender-hearted to do this and left the maiden in the wood and went home again. snowdrop wandered about until she came to the house of seven little dwarfs, and they were so kind as to take her in and let her live with them. she used to make their seven little beds, and prepare the meals for the seven little men, and they were all quite happy until the queen found out from her mirror that snowdrop was alive still, for, as it always told the truth, it still told her snowdrop was the fairest lady in the land.  she decided that snowdrop must die, so she dyed her face and dressed up like an old pedlar, and in this disguise she went to the home of the seven dwarfs and called out, laces for sale.  snowdrop peeped out of the window and said, good-day, mother; what have you to sell?  good laces, fine laces, laces of every color, and she held out one that was made of gay silk.  snowdrop opened the door and bought the pretty lace.  child, said the old woman, you are a sight, let me lace you properly for once.  snowdrop placed herself before the old woman, who laced her so quickly and so tightly that she took away snowdrop's breath and she fell down as though dead.  not long after the seven dwarfs came home they found that she was laced too tight and cut the lace, whereupon snowdrop began to breathe and soon came back to life again.  when the queen got home and found by asking her mirror that snowdrop was still alive, she planned to make an end of her for good, so she made a poisoned comb and disguised herself to look like a different old woman.  she journeyed to the dwarfs' home and induced snowdrop to let her comb her hair. the minute she put the poisoned comb in her hair snowdrop fell down as though dead.  when the seven dwarfs came home they found their poor snowdrop on the floor, and suspecting the bad queen began to look for the cause, soon finding the comb. no sooner had they removed it than snowdrop came to life again.  upon the queen's return home she found by asking her mirror that snowdrop still lived, so she disguised herself a third time and came to the dwarfs' little house and gave snowdrop a poisoned apple. as soon as the little princess took a bite it stuck in her throat and choked her.  oh! how grieved were the good little dwarfs. they made a fine glass coffin, and put snowdrop into it and were carrying her away to bury her when they met a prince, who fell in love with the little dead maiden, and begged the dwarfs to give her to him.  the dwarfs were so sorry for him they consented, and the prince's servants were about to carry the coffin away when they stumbled and fell over the root of a tree. snowdrop received such a violent jerk that the poisonous apple was jerked right out of her throat and she sat up alive and well again.  of course she married the prince, and she, her husband and the good little dwarfs lived happily ever after, but the cruel step-mother came to a bad end, and no one was even sorry for her.\",\n          \"one morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.  he pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.  a gig was coming along the road; it was driven by mr. mcgregor, and beside him sat mrs. mcgregor in her best bonnet.  as soon as they had passed, little benjamin bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of mr. mcgregor's garden.      that wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived benjamin's aunt and his cousins--flopsy, mopsy, cotton-tail, and peter.  old mrs. rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (i once bought a pair at a bazaar). she also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).  little benjamin did not very much want to see his aunt.  he came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin peter.      peter was sitting by himself. he looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.  peter, said little benjamin, in a whisper, who has got your clothes?  peter replied, the scarecrow in mr. mcgregor's garden, and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.  little benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that mr. mcgregor had gone out in a gig, and mrs. mcgregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.      peter said he hoped that it would rain.  at this point old mrs. rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: cotton-tail! cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!  peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.  they went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. from here they looked down into mr. mcgregor's garden. peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of mr. mcgregor's.      little benjamin said: it spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.  peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.  it had been sown with lettuces.  they left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little benjamin, who was wearing clogs.      little benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.  they took them off the scarecrow. there had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.  benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.  then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his aunt.  peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.       benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. he said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their sunday dinner.  (the name of little benjamin's papa was old mr. benjamin bunny.)  the lettuces certainly were very fine.  peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. presently he dropped half the onions.      little benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. he led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. they went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.  the mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at peter rabbit and little benjamin bunny.  presently peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.      they got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!  he was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.  this is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!  little benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and peter and the onions underneath a large basket....      the cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.  perhaps she liked the smell of onions!  anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.  she sat there for five hours.                                       i cannot draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry.  the sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.      at length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.  the cat looked up and saw old mr. benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.  he was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.  he was looking for his son.  old mr. bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.  he took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.  the cat was too much surprised to scratch back.      when old mr. bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.  then he came back to the basket and took out his son benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.  then he took out his nephew peter.  then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.    when mr. mcgregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.  it looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!  also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse, locking the door upon the outside.      when peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. cotton-tail and peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old mrs. rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco. a farmyard tale     for     ralph and betsy      what a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!  --listen to the story of jemima puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.    her sister-in-law, mrs. rebeccah puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else--i have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, jemima. you would let them go cold; you know you would!  i wish to hatch my own eggs; i will hatch them all by myself, quacked jemima puddle-duck.    she tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.  jemima puddle-duck became quite desperate. she determined to make a nest right away from the farm.    she set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill.  she was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.    when she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.  she thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.    jemima puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. she ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.    she flew beautifully when she had got a good start.  she skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.    jemima alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place. she rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves.  but--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.  he had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.  quack? said jemima puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side--quack?    the gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at jemima--  madam, have you lost your way? said he. he had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.  jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. she explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place.    ah! is that so? indeed! said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at jemima. he folded up the newspaper, and put it in his coat-tail pocket.  jemima complained of the superfluous hen.  indeed! how interesting! i wish i could meet with that fowl. i would teach it to mind its own business!    but as to a nest--there is no difficulty: i have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. no, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. you may sit there as long as you like, said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.  he led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves.  it was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.    this is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient, said the hospitable gentleman.  there was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes. the gentleman opened the door, and showed jemima in.    the shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.  jemima puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. but it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.    when she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.  he was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let jemima go home for the night. he promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day.  he said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed.    jemima puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. they were greeny white and very large. the foxy gentleman admired them immensely. he used to turn them over and count them when jemima was not there.  at last jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--and i will bring a bag of corn with me, so that i need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. they might catch cold, said the conscientious jemima.    madam, i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; i will provide oats. but before you commence your tedious sitting, i intend to give you a treat. let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!  may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. i will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelette, said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.    jemima puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.  she went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.    and she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.  the collie-dog kep met her coming out, what are you doing with those onions? where do you go every afternoon by yourself, jemima puddle-duck?  jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.  the collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.    he asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed.  then he went out, and trotted down the village. he went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.    jemima puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. she was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.  she flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.    he was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. when jemima alighted he quite jumped.  come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. give me the herbs for the omelette. be sharp!  he was rather abrupt. jemima puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.  she felt surprised, and uncomfortable.    while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it.  jemima became much alarmed.    a moment afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans.  and nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.  presently kep opened the door of the shed, and let out jemima puddle-duck.    unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.  he had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.    jemima puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.    she laid some more in june, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched.  jemima puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter. once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie, who lived at a farm called little-town. she was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!  one day little lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so! i've lost my pocket-handkin! three handkins and a pinny! have you seen them, tabby kitten?    the kitten went on washing her white paws; so lucie asked a speckled hen--  sally henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins?  but the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--  i go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!      and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig.  cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.  lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  and a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.    lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!    presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.  some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! and where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a very small person.  lucie ran on, and on.    the path ended under a big rock. the grass was short and green, and there were clothes--props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  but there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      lily-white and clean, oh!      with little frills between, oh!       smooth and hot--red rusty spot      never here be seen, oh!    lucie, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. a little frightened voice called out who's that?  lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. only the ceiling was so low that lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.    there was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at lucie.  her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where lucie had yellow curls--that little person had prickles!    who are you? said lucie. have you seen my pocket-handkins?  the little person made a bob-curtsey--oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is mrs. tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, i'm an excellent clear-starcher! and she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.    what's that thing? said lucie--that's not my pocket-handkin?  oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to cock robin!  and she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.    then she took something else off a clothes-horse--  that isn't my pinny? said lucie.  oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to jenny wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! it's very bad to wash! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    mrs. tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.    there's one of my pocket-handkins! cried lucie--and there's my pinny!  mrs. tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.  oh that is lovely! said lucie.    and what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?  oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to sally henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! she'll very soon go barefoot! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    why, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?  oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old mrs. rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! i've had to wash it separately, i can't get out the smell.  there's another one of mine, said lucie.    what are those funny little white things?  that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten; i only have to iron them; she washes them herself.  there's my last pocket-handkin! said lucie.    and what are you dipping into the basin of starch?  they're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to tom titmouse--most terrible particular! said mrs. tiggy-winkle. now i've finished my ironing; i'm going to air some clothes.    what are these dear soft fluffy things? said lucie.  oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at skelghyl.  will their jackets take off? asked lucie.  oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. and here's one marked for gatesgarth, and three that come from little-town. they're always marked at washing! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!    then mrs. tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for lucie. they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. mrs. tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that lucie didn't like to sit too near her.    when they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.  and then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.    then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs. tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!  all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny!    and she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs. tiggy-winkle.    so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except lucie's one little bundle.    lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say good-night, and to thank the washer-woman--but what a very odd thing! mrs. tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!  she was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?    and how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with prickles!  why! mrs. tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog.                                           (now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the     stile--but then how could she have found three clean     pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?      and besides--i have seen that door into the back of the hill     called cat bells--and besides i am very well acquainted with     dear mrs. tiggy-winkle!) once upon a time there were four little rabbits, and their names were--            flopsy,        mopsy,    cotton-tail, and peter.  they lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.  'now my dears,' said old mrs. rabbit one morning, 'you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into mr. mcgregor's garden: your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by mrs. mcgregor.'  'now run along, and don't get into mischief. i am going out.'  then old mrs. rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.  flopsy, mopsy, and cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries:  but peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to mr. mcgregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!  first he ate some lettuces and some french beans; and then he ate some radishes;  and then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.  but round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but mr. mcgregor!  mr. mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after peter, waving a rake and calling out, 'stop thief!'  peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.  he lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.  after losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that i think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. it was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.  peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.  mr. mcgregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of peter; but peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.  and rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.  mr. mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. he began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.  presently peter sneezed--'kertyschoo!' mr. mcgregor was after him in no time.  and tried to put his foot upon peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. the window was too small for mr. mcgregor, and he was tired of running after peter. he went back to his work.  peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. also he was very damp with sitting in that can.  after a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all round.  he found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.  an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. she only shook her head at him. peter began to cry.  then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. presently, he came to a pond where mr. mcgregor filled his water-cans. a white cat was staring at some gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little benjamin bunny.  he went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. peter scuttered underneath the bushes. but presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. the first thing he saw was mr. mcgregor hoeing onions. his back was turned towards peter, and beyond him was the gate!  peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.  mr. mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner, but peter did not care. he slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.  mr. mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.  peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.  he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. his mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight!  i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening.  his mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to peter!  'one table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'  but flopsy, mopsy, and cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper. this is a tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was nutkin.  he had a brother called twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.    in the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called old brown.    one autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green--nutkin and twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.    they made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to owl island to gather nuts.  each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.    they also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for old brown, and put them down upon his door-step.  then twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--  old mr. brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?    but nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. he bobbed up and down like a little red cherry, singing--      riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!      a little wee man, in a red red coat!      a staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;      if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a groat.  now this riddle is as old as the hills; mr. brown paid no attention whatever to nutkin.  he shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.    but next morning they all came back again to owl island; and twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of old brown's doorway, and said--  mr. brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?    but nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old mr. brown with a nettle and singing--      old mr. b! riddle-me-ree!      hitty pitty within the wall,      hitty pitty without the wall;      if you touch hitty pitty,      hitty pitty will bite you!  mr. brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.    he shut the door in nutkin's face. presently a little thread of blue smoke from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--      a house full, a hole full!      and you cannot gather a bowl-full!      the squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.  but nutkin gathered oak-apples--yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old mr. brown.    on the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for old brown.  they paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on owl island.    twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. he ran in front, singing--      the man in the wilderness said to me,     'how many strawberries grow in the sea?'      i answered him as i thought good--      'as many red herrings as grow in the wood.'  but old mr. brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.    on the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in plum-pudding for old brown. each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.  but nutkin sang as rudely as ever--       old mr. b! riddle-me-ree       flour of england, fruit of spain,       met together in a shower of rain;       put in a bag tied round with a string,     if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a ring!   which was ridiculous of nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to old brown.    the other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but nutkin gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins.    on the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. they had stolen it out of a bumble bees' nest on the tippitty top of the hill.  but nutkin skipped up and down, singing--      hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! hum-a-bum buzz!       as i went over tipple-tine       i met a flock of bonny swine;     some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!       they were the very bonniest swine       that e'er went over tipple-tine.    old mr. brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of nutkin.  but he ate up the honey!    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.  but nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.    on the sixth day, which was saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid egg in a little rush basket as a last parting present for old brown.  but nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--      humpty dumpty lies in the beck,      with a white counterpane round his neck,      forty doctors and forty wrights,      cannot put humpty dumpty to rights!    now old mr. brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. but still he did not speak.    nutkin became more and more impertinent--        old mr. b! old mr. b!     hickamore, hackamore, on the king's kitchen door;     all the king's horses, and all the king's men,     couldn't drive hickamore, hackamore,     off the king's kitchen door.  nutkin danced up and down like a sunbeam; but still old brown said nothing at all.    nutkin began again--      arthur o'bower has broken his band,      he comes roaring up the land!      the king of scots with all his power,      cannot turn arthur of the bower!  nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the wind, and he took a running jump right onto the head of old brown!...  then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud squeak!  the other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.    when they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree--there was old brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.                                       but nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!    this looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.    old brown carried nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic window.    and to this day, if you meet nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--  cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k! once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were mittens, tom kitten, and moppet.  they had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.  but one day their mother--mrs. tabitha twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.      first she scrubbed their faces (this one is moppet).  then she brushed their fur, (this one is mittens).      then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is tom kitten).  tom was very naughty, and he scratched.  mrs. tabitha dressed moppet and mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son thomas.      tom kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. his mother sewed them on again.  when the three kittens were ready, mrs. tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.  now keep your frocks clean, children! you must walk on your hind legs. keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from sally henny penny, and from the pig-stye and the puddle-ducks.      moppet and mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.  when they stood up there were several green smears!  let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall, said moppet.  they turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.      tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. he came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left.  he was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.  moppet and mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.      while they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step--pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!  they stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. they had very small eyes and looked surprised.      then the two duck-birds, rebeccah and jemima puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.  mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. moppet and tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of tom's clothes came off on the way down.  come! mr. drake puddle-duck, said moppet--come and help us to dress him! come and button up tom!      mr. drake puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles.  but he put them on himself! they fitted him even worse than tom kitten.  it's a very fine morning! said mr. drake puddle-duck.      and he and jemima and rebeccah puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!  then tabitha twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.      she pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.  my friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; i am affronted, said mrs. tabitha twitchit.  she sent them upstairs; and i am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true.      quite the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least.  somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.  and i think that some day i shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about tom kitten!    as for the puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.  the clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.      and mr. drake puddle-duck, and jemima and rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.\",\n          \"the following lines by mr. lear were written for a young lady of his acquaintance, who had quoted to him the words of a young lady not of his acquaintance,    how pleasant to know mr. lear!        how pleasant to know mr. lear!         who has written such volumes of stuff!       some think him ill-tempered and queer,         but a few think him pleasant enough.        his mind is concrete and fastidious,         his nose is remarkably big;       his visage is more or less hideous,         his beard it resembles a wig.        he has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers,         leastways if you reckon two thumbs;       long ago he was one of the singers,         but now he is one of the dumbs.        he sits in a beautiful parlor,         with hundreds of books on the wall;       he drinks a great deal of marsala,         but never gets tipsy at all.        he has many friends, lay men and clerical,         old foss is the name of his cat;       his body is perfectly spherical,         he weareth a runcible hat.        when he walks in waterproof white,         the children run after him so!       calling out, he's come out in his night-         gown, that crazy old englishman, oh!        he weeps by the side of the ocean,         he weeps on the top of the hill;       he purchases pancakes and lotion,         and chocolate shrimps from the mill.        he reads, but he cannot speak, spanish,         he cannot abide ginger beer:       ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,         how pleasant to know mr. lear!                                              introduction.  edward lear, the artist, author of journals of a landscape painter in various out-of-the-way countries, and of the delightful books of nonsense, which have amused successive generations of children, died on sunday, january 29, 1888, at san remo, italy, where he had lived for twenty years. few names could evoke a wider expression of passing regret at their appearance in the obituary column; for until his health began to fail he was known to an immense and almost a cosmopolitan circle of acquaintance, and popular wherever he was known. fewer still could call up in the minds of intimate friends a deeper and more enduring feeling of sorrow for personal loss, mingled with the pleasantest of memories; for it was impossible to know him thoroughly and not to love him. london, rome, the mediterranean countries generally, ceylon and india, are still all dotted with survivors among his generation who will mourn for him affectionately, although his latter years were spent in comparatively close retirement. he was a man of striking nobility of nature, fearless, independent, energetic, given to forming for himself strong opinions, often hastily, sometimes bitterly; not always strong or sound in judgment, but always seeking after truth in every matter, and following it as he understood it in scorn of consequence; utterly unselfish, devoted to his friends, generous even to extravagance towards any one who had ever been connected with his fortunes or his travels; playful, light-hearted, witty, and humorous, but not without those occasional fits of black depression and nervous irritability to which such temperaments are liable.  great and varied as the merits of his pictures are, lear hardly succeeded in achieving any great popularity as a landscape-painter. his work was frequently done on private commission, and he rarely sent in pictures for the academy or other exhibitions. his larger and more highly finished landscapes were unequal in technical perfection,--sometimes harsh or cold in color, or stiff in composition; sometimes full of imagination, at others literal and prosaic,--but always impressive reproductions of interesting or peculiar scenery. in later years he used in conversation to qualify himself as a topographical artist; and the definition was true, though not exhaustive. he had an intuitive and a perfectly trained eye for the character and beauty of distant mountain lines, the solemnity of rocky gorges, the majesty of a single mountain rising from a base of plain or sea; and he was equally exact in rendering the true forms of the middle distances and the specialties of foreground detail belonging to the various lands through which he had wandered as a sketcher. some of his pictures show a mastery which has rarely been equalled over the difficulties of painting an immense plain as seen from a height, reaching straight away from the eye of the spectator until it is lost in a dim horizon. sir roderick murchison used to say that he always understood the geological peculiarities of a country he had only studied in lear's sketches. the compliment was thoroughly justified; and it is not every landscape-painter to whom it could honestly be paid.  the history of lear's choice of a career was a curious one. he was the youngest of twenty-one children, and, through a family mischance, was thrown entirely on the limited resources of an elderly sister at a very early age. as a boy he had always dabbled in colors for his own amusement, and had been given to poring over the ordinary boys' books upon natural history. it occurred to him to try to turn his infant talents to account; and he painted upon cardboard a couple of birds in the style which the older among us remember as having been called oriental tinting, took them to a small shop, and sold them for fourpence. the kindness of friends, to whom he was ever grateful, gave him the opportunity of more serious and more remunerative study, and he became a patient and accurate zo\\u00f6logical draughtsman. many of the birds in the earlier volumes of gould's magnificent folios were drawn for him by lear. a few years back there were eagles alive in the zo\\u00f6logical gardens in regent's park to which lear could point as old familiar friends that he had drawn laboriously from claw to beak fifty years before. he united with this kind of work the more unpleasant occupation of drawing the curiosities of disease or deformity in hospitals. one day, as he was busily intent on the portrait of a bird in the zo\\u00f6logical gardens, an old gentleman came and looked over his shoulder, entered into conversation, and finally said to him, you must come and draw my birds at knowsley. lear did not know where knowsley was, or what it meant; but the old gentleman was the thirteenth earl of derby. the successive earls of derby have been among lear's kindest and most generous patrons. he went to knowsley, and the drawings in the knowsley menagerie (now a rare and highly-prized work among book collectors) are by lear's hand. at knowsley he became a permanent favorite; and it was there that he composed in prolific succession his charming and wonderful series of utterly nonsensical rhymes and drawings. lear had already begun seriously to study landscape. when english winters began to threaten his health, lord derby started a subscription which enabled him to go to rome as a student and artist, and no doubt gave him recommendations among anglo-roman society which laid the foundations of a numerous client\\u00e8le. it was in the roman summers that lear first began to exercise the taste for pictorial wandering which grew into a habit and a passion, to fill vivid and copious note-books as he went, and to illustrate them by spirited and accurate drawings; and his first volume of illustrated excursions in italy, published in 1846, is gratefully dedicated to his knowsley patron.  only those who have travelled with him could know what a delightful comrade he was to men whose tastes ran more or less parallel to his own. it was not everybody who could travel with him; for he was so irrepressibly anxious not to lose a moment of the time at his disposal for gathering into his garners the beauty and interest of the lands over which he journeyed, that he was careless of comfort and health. calabria, sicily, the desert of sinai, egypt and nubia, greece and albania, palestine, syria, athos, candia, montenegro, zag\\u00f3ri (who knows now where zag\\u00f3ri is, or was?), were as thoroughly explored and sketched by him as the more civilized localities of malta, corsica, and corfu. he read insatiably before starting all the recognized guide-books and histories of the country he intended to draw; and his published itineraries are marked by great strength and literary interest quite irrespectively of the illustrations. and he had his reward. it is not any ordinary journalist and sketcher who could have compelled from tennyson such a tribute as lines to e.l. on his travels in greece:--      illyrian woodlands, echoing falls       of water, sheets of summer glass,       the long divine pene\\u00efan pass,     the vast akrokeraunian walls,      tomohrit, athos, all things fair,       with such a pencil, such a pen,       you shadow forth to distant men,     i read and felt that i was there.  lear was a man to whom, as to tennyson's ulysses,      all experience is an arch wherethrough     gleams that untravelled world.  after settling at san remo, and when he was nearly sixty years old, he determined to visit india and ceylon. he started once and failed, being taken so ill at suez that he was obliged to return. the next year he succeeded, and brought away some thousands of drawings of the most striking views from all three presidencies and from the tropical island. his appetite for travel continued to grow with what it fed upon; and although he hated a long sea-voyage, he used seriously to contemplate as possible a visit to relations in new zealand. it may safely, however, be averred that no considerations would have tempted him to visit the arctic regions.      a hard-working life, checkered by the odd adventures which happen     to the odd and the adventurous and pass over the commonplace; a     career brightened by the high appreciation of unimpeachable     critics; lightened, till of late, by the pleasant society and good     wishes of innumerable friends; saddened by the growing pressure of     ill health and solitude; cheered by his constant trust in the love     and sympathy of those who knew him best, however far away,--such     was the life of edward lear.        --the london saturday review, feb. 4, 1888.  among the writers who have striven with varying success during the last thirty or forty years to awaken the merriment of the rising generation of the time being, mr. edward lear occupies the first place in seniority, if not in merit. the parent of modern nonsense-writers, he is distinguished from all his followers and imitators by the superior consistency with which he has adhered to his aim,--that of amusing his readers by fantastic absurdities, as void of vulgarity or cynicism as they are incapable of being made to harbor any symbolical meaning. he never deviates into sense; but those who appreciate him never feel the need of such deviation. he has a genius for coining absurd names and words, which, even when they are suggested by the exigencies of his metre, have a ludicrous appropriateness to the matter in hand. his verse is, with the exception of a certain number of cockney rhymes, wonderfully flowing and even melodious--or, as he would say, meloobious--while to all these qualifications for his task must finally be added the happy gift of pictorial expression, enabling him to double, nay, often to quadruple, the laughable effect of his text by an inexhaustible profusion of the quaintest designs. generally speaking, these designs are, as it were, an idealization of the efforts of a clever child; but now and then--as in the case of the nonsense-botany--mr. lear reminds us what a genuine and graceful artist he really is. the advantage to a humorist of being able to illustrate his own text has been shown in the case of thackeray and mr. w.s. gilbert, to mention two familiar examples; but in no other instance of such a combination have we discovered such geniality as is to be found in the nonsense-pictures of mr. lear. we have spoken above of the melodiousness of mr. lear's verses, a quality which renders them excellently suitable for musical setting, and which has not escaped the notice of the author himself. we have also heard effective arrangements, presumably by other composers, of the adventures of the table and the chair, and of the cruise of the owl and the pussy-cat,--the latter introduced into the drawing-room entertainment of one of the followers of john parry. indeed, in these days of adaptations, it is to be wondered at that no enterprising librettist has attempted to build a children's comic opera out of the materials supplied in the four books with which we are now concerned. the first of these, originally published in 1846, and brought out in an enlarged form in 1863, is exclusively devoted to nonsense-verses of one type. mr. lear is careful to disclaim the credit of having created this type, for he tells us in the preface to his third book that the lines beginning, 'there was an old man of tobago,' were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse leading itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures. dismissing the further question of the authorship of there was an old man of tobago, we propose to give a few specimens of mr. lear's protean powers as exhibited in the variation of this simple type. here, to begin with, is a favorite verse, which we are very glad to have an opportunity of giving, as it is often incorrectly quoted, cocks being substituted for owls in the third line:      there was an old man with a beard,     who said, 'it is just as i feared!     two owls and a hen, four larks and a wren,     have all built their nests in my beard!'  with the kindly fatalism which is the distinctive note of the foregoing stanza, the sentiment of our next extract is in vivid contrast:--       there was an old man in a tree,     who was terribly bored by a bee;     when they said, 'does it buzz?' he replied, 'yes, it does!     it's a regular brute of a bee.'  to the foregoing verse an historic interest attaches, if, that is, we are right in supposing it to have inspired mr. gilbert with his famous nonsense-rhyme in blank verse. we quote from memory:--      there was an old man of st. bees,     who was stung in the arm by a wasp.     when they asked, 'does it hurt?' he replied, 'no, it doesn't,     but i thought all the while 'twas a hornet!'  passing over the lines referring to the young person of crete to whom the epithet ombliferous is applied, we may be pardoned--on the ground of the geographical proximity of the two countries named--for quoting together two stanzas which in reality are separated by a good many pages:--      there was a young lady of norway,     who casually sat in a doorway;     when the doors queezed her flat, she exclaimed, 'what of that?'     this courageous young person of norway.      there was a young lady of sweden,     who went by the slow train to weedon;     when they cried, 'weedon station!' she made no observation,     but thought she should go back to sweden.  a noticeable feature about this first book, and one which we think is peculiar to it, is the harsh treatment which the eccentricities of the inhabitants of certain towns appear to have met with at the hands of their fellow-residents. no less than three people are smashed,--the old man of whitehaven who danced a quadrille with a raven; the old person of buda; and the old man with a gong who bumped at it all the day long, though in the last-named case we admit that there was considerable provocation. before quitting the first nonsense-book, we would point out that it contains one or two forms that are interesting; for instance, scroobious, which we take to be a portmanteau word, and spickle-speckled, a favorite form of reduplication with mr. lear, and of which the best specimen occurs in his last book, he tinkledy-binkledy-winkled the bell. the second book, published in 1871, shows mr. lear in the maturity of sweet desipience, and will perhaps remain the favorite volume of the four to grown-up readers. the nonsense-songs are all good, and the story of the four little children who went round the world is the most exquisite piece of imaginative absurdity that the present writer is acquainted with. but before coming to that, let us quote a few lines from the jumblies, who, as all the world knows, went to sea in a sieve:--        they sailed to the western sea, they did,       to a land all covered with trees.     and they bought an owl, and a useful cart,     and a pound of rice, and a cranberry tart,       and a hive of silvery bees.     and they bought a pig, and some green jack-daws,     and a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,     and forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,       and no end of stilton cheese.         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live.         their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.     and in twenty years they all came back,       in twenty years or more,     and every one said, 'how tall they've grown!     for they've been to the lakes, and the torrible zone,       and the hills of the chankly bore.'  from the pedestrian excursion of the table and the chair, we cannot resist making a brief quotation, though in this, as in every case, the inability to quote the drawings also is a sad drawback:--      so they both went slowly down,     and walked about the town,     with a cheerful bumpy sound,     as they toddled round and round.     and everybody cried,     as they hastened to their side,     'see, the table and the chair     have come out to take the air!'      but in going down an alley     to a castle in a valley,     they completely lost their way,     and wandered all the day,     till, to see them safely back,     they paid a ducky-quack,     and a beetle and a mouse,     who took them to their house.      then they whispered to each other,     'o delightful little brother,     what a lovely walk we've taken!     let us dine on beans and bacon!'     so the ducky and the leetle     browny-mousy, and the beetle     dined, and danced upon their heads,     till they toddled to their beds.  the story of the four little children who went round the world follows next, and the account of the manner in which they occupied themselves while on shipboard may be transcribed for the benefit of those unfortunate persons who have not perused the original: during the day-time violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt-water into a churn, while her three brothers churned it violently in the hope it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did. after journeying for a time, they saw some land at a distance, and when they came to it they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. besides that it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses with a great gulf-stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, five hundred and three feet high. in a later passage, we read how by-and-by the children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. each of these blue bottles contained a bluebottlefly, and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony, nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. our last quotation from this inimitable recital shall be from the description of their adventure on a great plain where they espied an object which on a nearer approach and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cake and oyster-shells. this turned out to be the co-operative cauliflower, who, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust ... suddenly arose, and in a somewhat plumdomphious manner hurried off towards the setting sun, his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers ... till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand. so remarkable a sight of course impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.  in his third book, mr. lear takes occasion in an entertaining preface to repudiate the charge of harboring any ulterior motive beyond that of nonsense pure and absolute in any of his verses or pictures, and tells a delightful anecdote illustrative of the persistently absurd report that the earl of derby was the author of the first book of nonsense. in this volume he reverts once more to the familiar form adopted in his original efforts, and with little falling off. it is to be remarked that the third division is styled twenty-six nonsense rhymes and pictures, although there is no more rhyme than reason in any of the set. our favorite illustrations are those of the scroobious snake who always wore a hat on his head, for fear he should bite anybody, and the visibly vicious vulture who wrote some verses to a veal-cutlet in a volume bound in vellum. in the fourth and last of mr. lear's books, we meet not only with familiar words, but personages and places,--old friends like the jumblies, the yonghy-bonghy-bo, the quangle wangle, the hills of the chankly bore, and the great gromboolian plain, as well as new creations, such as the dong with a luminous nose, whose story is a sort of nonsense version of the love of nausicaa for ulysses, only that the sexes are inverted. in these verses, graceful fancy is so subtly interwoven with nonsense as almost to beguile us into feeling a real interest in mr. lear's absurd creations. so again in the pelican chorus there are some charming lines:--      by day we fish, and at eve we stand     on long bare islands of yellow sand.     and when the sun sinks slowly down,     and the great rock-walls grow dark and brown,     when the purple river rolls fast and dim,     and the ivory ibis starlike skim,     wing to wing we dance around, etc.  the other nonsense-poems are all good, but we have no space for further quotation, and will take leave of our subject by propounding the following set of examination questions which a friend who is deeply versed in mr. lear's books has drawn up for us:--    1. what do you gather from a study of mr. lear's works to      have been the prevalent characteristics of the inhabitants of      gretna, prague, thermopylae, wick, and hong kong?    2. state briefly what historical events are connected with      ischia, chertsey, whitehaven, boulak, and jellibolee.    3. comment, with illustrations, upon mr. lear's use of the      following words: runcible, propitious, dolomphious, borascible,      fizzgiggious, himmeltanious, tumble-dum-down, spongetaneous.    4. enumerate accurately all the animals who lived on the      quangle wangle's hat, and explain how the quangle wangle      was enabled at once to enlighten his five travelling companions      as to the true nature of the co-operative cauliflower.    5. what were the names of the five daughters of the old      person of china, and what was the purpose for which the      old man of the dargle purchased six barrels of gargle?    6. collect notices of king xerxes in mr. lear's works, and      state your theory, if you have any, as to the character and      appearance of nupiter piffkin.    7. draw pictures of the plum-pudding flea, and the moppsikon      floppsikon bear, and state by whom waterproof tubs      were first used.    8.         there was an old man at a station                who made a promiscuous oration.       what bearing may we assume the foregoing couplet to have      upon mr. lear's political views?                                    --the london spectator.                                               a book of nonsense  by  edward lear.  with all the original pictures and verses           there was an old derry down derry, who loved to see little folks   merry;     so he made them a book, and with laughter they shook       at the fun of that derry down derry.                     original dedication.                         to the  great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces            of edward, 13th earl of derby,           this book of drawings and verses       (the greater part of which were originally          made and composed for their parents.)                 is dedicated by the author,                                           edward lear.         london, 1862.                                                         there was an old man with a nose,     who said, if you choose to suppose     that my nose is too long, you are certainly wrong!     that remarkable man with a nose.            there was a young person of smyrna,     whose grandmother threatened to burn her;     but she seized on the cat, and said, granny, burn that!     you incongruous old woman of smyrna!            there was an old man on a hill,     who seldom, if ever, stood still;     he ran up and down in his grandmother's gown,     which adorned that old man on a hill.            there was an old person of chili,     whose conduct was painful and silly;     he sate on the stairs, eating apples and pears,     that imprudent old person of chili.            there was an old man with a gong,     who bumped at it all the day long;     but they called out, oh, law! you're a horrid old bore!     so they smashed that old man with a gong.            there was an old man of kilkenny,     who never had more than a penny;     he spent all that money in onions and honey,     that wayward old man of kilkenny.            there was an old man of columbia,     who was thirsty, and called out for some beer;     but they brought it quite hot, in a small copper pot,     which disgusted that man of columbia.            there was an old man in a tree,     who was horribly bored by a bee;     when they said, does it buzz? he replied, yes, it does!     it's a regular brute of a bee.            there was an old lady of chertsey,     who made a remarkable curtsey;     she twirled round and round, till she sank underground,     which distressed all the people of chertsey.            there was a young lady whose chin     resembled the point of a pin;

    and, as it was too soon to dine,     they drank some periwinkle-wine,     and played an hour or two, or more,     at battlecock and shuttledore.                       ii.      said mr. daddy long-legs         to mr. floppy fly,     why do you never come to court?         i wish you 'd tell me why.     all gold and shine, in dress so fine,         you'd quite delight the court.     why do you never go at all?         i really think you ought.     and, if you went, you'd see such sights!     such rugs and jugs and candle-lights!     and, more than all, the king and queen,--     one in red, and one in green.                       iii.      o mr. daddy long-legs!         said mr. floppy fly,     it's true i never go to court;         and i will tell you why.     if i had six long legs like yours,         at once i'd go to court;     but, oh! i can't, because my legs         are so extremely short.     and i'm afraid the king and queen     (one in red, and one in green)     would say aloud, 'you are not fit,     you fly, to come to court a bit!'                       iv.      oh, mr. daddy long-legs!         said mr. floppy fly,     i wish you 'd sing one little song,         one mumbian melody.     you used to sing so awful well         in former days gone by;     but now you never sing at all:         i wish you'd tell me why:     for, if you would, the silvery sound     would please the shrimps and cockles round,     and all the crabs would gladly come     to hear you sing, 'ah, hum di hum!'                       v.      said mr. daddy long-legs,        i can never sing again;     and, if you wish, i'll tell you why,         although it gives me pain.     for years i cannot hum a bit,         or sing the smallest song;     and this the dreadful reason is,--         my legs are grown too long!     my six long legs, all here and there,     oppress my bosom with despair;     and, if i stand or lie or sit,     i cannot sing one single bit!                       vi.      so mr. daddy long-legs         and mr. floppy fly     sat down in silence by the sea,         and gazed upon the sky.     they said, this is a dreadful thing!         the world has all gone wrong,     since one has legs too short by half,         the other much too long.     one never more can go to court,     because his legs have grown too short;     the other cannot sing a song,     because his legs have grown too long!                       vii.      then mr. daddy long-legs         and mr. floppy fly     rushed downward to the foamy sea         with one sponge-taneous cry:     and there they found a little boat,         whose sails were pink and gray;     and off they sailed among the waves,         far and far away:     they sailed across the silent main,     and reached the great gromboolian plain;     and there they play forevermore     at battlecock and shuttledore.       the jumblies.                        i.      they went to sea in a sieve, they did;         in a sieve they went to sea:     in spite of all their friends could say,     on a winter's morn, on a stormy day,         in a sieve they went to sea.     and when the sieve turned round and round,     and every one cried, you'll all be drowned!     they called aloud, our sieve ain't big;     but we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:         in a sieve we'll go to sea!              far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:              their heads are green, and their hands are blue         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        ii.      they sailed away in a sieve, they did,         in a sieve they sailed so fast,     with only a beautiful pea-green veil     tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,         to a small tobacco-pipe mast.     and every one said who saw them go,    oh! won't they be soon upset, you know?     for the sky is dark, and the voyage is long;     and, happen what may, it's extremely wrong         in a sieve to sail so fast.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        iii.      the water it soon came in, it did;         the water it soon came in:     so, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet         in a pinky paper all folded neat;     and they fastened it down with a pin.     and they passed the night in a crockery-jar;     and each of them said, how wise we are!     though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,     yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,         while round in our sieve we spin.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        iv.      and all night long they sailed away;         and when the sun went down,     they whistled and warbled a moony song         to the echoing sound of a coppery gong,     in the shade of the mountains brown.    o timballoo! how happy we are     when we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!     and all night long, in the moonlight pale,     we sail away with a pea-green sail         in the shade of the mountains brown.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        v.      they sailed to the western sea, they did,--         to a land all covered with trees:     and they bought an owl, and a useful cart,         and a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,     and a hive of silvery bees;     and they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,     and a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,     and forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,         and no end of stilton cheese.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.                        vi.      and in twenty years they all came back,--         in twenty years or more;     and every one said, how tall they've grown!         for they've been to the lakes, and the torrible zone,     and the hills of the chankly bore.     and they drank their health, and gave them a feast     of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;     and every one said, if we only live,     we, too, will go to sea in a sieve,         to the hills of the chankly bore.             far and few, far and few,         are the lands where the jumblies live:             their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         and they went to sea in a sieve.     the nutcrackers and the sugar-tongs.                         i.      the nutcrackers sate by a plate on the table;         the sugar-tongs sate by a plate at his side;     and the nutcrackers said, don't you wish we were able         along the blue hills and green meadows to ride?     must we drag on this stupid existence forever,         so idle and weary, so full of remorse,     while every one else takes his pleasure, and never         seems happy unless he is riding a horse?                        ii.      don't you think we could ride without being instructed,         without any saddle or bridle or spur?     our legs are so long, and so aptly constructed,         i'm sure that an accident could not occur.     let us all of a sudden hop down from the table,         and hustle downstairs, and each jump on a horse!     shall we try? shall we go? do you think we are able?         the sugar-tongs answered distinctly, of course!                        iii.      so down the long staircase they hopped in a minute;         the sugar-tongs snapped, and the crackers said crack!     the stable was open; the horses were in it:         each took out a pony, and jumped on his back.     the cat in a fright scrambled out of the doorway;         the mice tumbled out of a bundle of hay;     the brown and white rats, and the black ones from norway,         screamed out, they are taking the horses away!                        iv.      the whole of the household was filled with amazement:         the cups and the saucers danced madly about;     the plates and the dishes looked out of the casement;         the salt-cellar stood on his head with a shout;     the spoons, with a clatter, looked out of the lattice;         the mustard-pot climbed up the gooseberry-pies;     the soup-ladle peeped through a heap of veal-patties,         and squeaked with a ladle-like scream of surprise.                        v.      the frying-pan said, it's an awful delusion!         the tea-kettle hissed, and grew black in the face;     and they all rushed downstairs in the wildest confusion         to see the great nutcracker-sugar-tong race.     and out of the stable, with screamings and laughter         (their ponies were cream-colored, speckled with brown),     the nutcrackers first, and the sugar-tongs after;         rode all round the yard, and then all round the town.                        vi.      they rode through the street, and they rode by the station;         they galloped away to the beautiful shore;     in silence they rode, and made no observation,         save this: we will never go back any more!     and still you might hear, till they rode out of hearing,         the sugar-tongs snap, and the crackers say crack!     till, far in the distance their forms disappearing,         they faded away; and they never came back!     calico pie.                         i.        calico pie,       the little birds fly     down to the calico-tree:       their wings were blue,       and they sang tilly-loo!       till away they flew;         and they never came back to me!           they never came back,           they never came back,         they never came back to me!                        ii.        calico jam,       the little fish swam     over the syllabub sea.       he took off his hat       to the sole and the sprat,       and the willeby-wat:         but he never came back to me;           he never came back,           he never came back,         he never came back to me.                                         iii.        calico ban,       the little mice ran     to be ready in time for tea;       flippity flup,       they drank it all up,       and danced in the cup:         but they never came back to me;           they never came back,           they never came back,         they never came back to me.                                         iv.        calico drum,       the grasshoppers come,     the butterfly, beetle, and bee,       over the ground,       around and round,       with a hop and a bound;         but they never came back,           they never came back,           they never came back.         they never came back to me.                      mr. and mrs. spikky sparrow.                         i.      on a little piece of wood     mr. spikky sparrow stood:     mrs. sparrow sate close by,     a-making of an insect-pie     for her little children five,     in the nest and all alive;     singing with a cheerful smile,     to amuse them all the while,        twikky wikky wikky wee,         wikky bikky twikky tee,             spikky bikky bee!                        ii.      mrs. spikky sparrow said,     spikky, darling! in my head     many thoughts of trouble come,     like to flies upon a plum.     all last night, among the trees,     i heard you cough, i heard you sneeze;     and thought i, 'it's come to that     because he does not wear a hat!'         chippy wippy sikky tee,         bikky wikky tikky mee,             spikky chippy wee!                        iii.      not that you are growing old;     but the nights are growing cold.     no one stays out all night long     without a hat: i'm sure it's wrong!     mr. spikky said, how kind,     dear, you are, to speak your mind!     all your life i wish you luck!     you are, you are, a lovely duck!         witchy witchy witchy wee,         twitchy witchy witchy bee,             tikky tikky tee!                        iv.      i was also sad, and thinking,     when one day i saw you winking,     and i heard you sniffle-snuffle,     and i saw your feathers ruffle:     to myself i sadly said,     'she's neuralgia in her head!     that dear head has nothing on it!     ought she not to wear a bonnet?'         witchy kitchy kitchy wee,         spikky wikky mikky bee,             chippy wippy chee!                        v.      let us both fly up to town:     there i'll buy you such a gown!     which, completely in the fashion,     you shall tie a sky-blue sash on;     and a pair of slippers neat     to fit your darling little feet,     so that you will look and feel     quite galloobious and genteel.         jikky wikky bikky see,         chicky bikky wikky bee,             twicky witchy wee!                        vi.      so they both to london went,     alighting on the monument;     whence they flew down swiftly--pop!     into moses' wholesale shop:     there they bought a hat and bonnet,     and a gown with spots upon it,     a satin sash of cloxam blue,     and a pair of slippers too.         zikky wikky mikky bee,         witchy witchy mitchy kee,             sikky tikky wee!                        vii.      then, when so completely dressed,     back they flew, and reached their nest.     their children cried, o ma and pa!     how truly beautiful you are!     said they, we trust that cold or pain     we shall never feel again;     while, perched on tree or house or steeple,     we now shall look like other people.         witchy witchy witchy wee,         twikky mikky bikky bee,             zikky sikky tee!                      the broom, the shovel, the poker, and the tongs.                         i.      the broom and the shovel, the poker and tongs,       they all took a drive in the park;     and they each sang a song, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!       before they went back in the dark.     mr. poker he sate quite upright in the coach;       mr. tongs made a clatter and clash;     miss shovel was dressed all in black (with a brooch);       mrs. broom was in blue (with a sash).         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         and they all sang a song.                        ii.     o shovely so lovely! the poker he sang,      you have perfectly conquered my heart.     ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong! if you're pleased with my song,       i will feed you with cold apple-tart.     when you scrape up the coals with a delicate sound,       you enrapture my life with delight,     your nose is so shiny, your head is so round,       and your shape is so slender and bright!         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         ain't you pleased with my song?                        iii.     alas! mrs. broom, sighed the tongs in his song,      oh! is it because i'm so thin,     and my legs are so long,--ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!--       that you don't care about me a pin?     ah! fairest of creatures, when sweeping the room,       ah! why don't you heed my complaint?     must you needs be so cruel, you beautiful broom,       because you are covered with paint?         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         you are certainly wrong.                        iv.      mrs. broom and miss shovel together they sang,      what nonsense you're singing to-day!     said the shovel, i'll certainly hit you a bang!       said the broom, and i'll sweep you away!     so the coachman drove homeward as fast as he could,       perceiving their anger with pain;     but they put on the kettle, and little by little       they all became happy again.         ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!         there's an end of my song.     the table and the chair.                         i.      said the table to the chair,     you can hardly be aware     how i suffer from the heat     and from chilblains on my feet.     if we took a little walk,     we might have a little talk;     pray let us take the air,     said the table to the chair.                        ii.      said the chair unto the table,     now, you know we are not able:     how foolishly you talk,     when you know we cannot walk!     said the table with a sigh,     it can do no harm to try.     i've as many legs as you:     why can't we walk on two?                        iii.      so they both went slowly down,     and walked about the town     with a cheerful bumpy sound     as they toddled round and round;     and everybody cried,     as they hastened to their side,     see! the table and the chair     have come out to take the air!                        iv.      but in going down an alley,     to a castle in a valley,     they completely lost their way,     and wandered all the day;     till, to see them safely back,     they paid a ducky-quack,     and a beetle, and a mouse,     who took them to their house.                                        v.      then they whispered to each other,     o delightful little brother,     what a lovely walk we've taken!     let us dine on beans and bacon.     so the ducky and the leetle     browny-mousy and the beetle     dined, and danced upon their heads     till they toddled to their beds.                                                              nonsense stories.   the story of the four little children who went round the world.  once upon a time, a long while ago, there were four little people whose names were    violet, slingsby, guy, and lionel; and they all thought they should like to see the world. so they bought a large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, and then they were to come back on the other side by land. the boat was painted blue with green spots, and the sail was yellow with red stripes: and, when they set off, they only took a small cat to steer and look after the boat, besides an elderly quangle-wangle, who had to cook the dinner and make the tea; for which purposes they took a large kettle.    for the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and found plenty to eat, as there were lots of fish; and they had only to take them out of the sea with a long spoon, when the quangle-wangle instantly cooked them; and the pussy-cat was fed with the bones, with which she expressed herself pleased, on the whole: so that all the party were very happy.  during the daytime, violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt water into a churn; while her three brothers churned it violently, in the hope that it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did; and in the evening they all retired into the tea-kettle, where they all managed to sleep very comfortably, while pussy and the quangle-wangle managed the boat.    after a time, they saw some land at a distance; and, when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses, with a great gulf-stream running about all over it; so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.  when they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their great surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and chocolate-drops, and nothing else. so they all climbed up the single high tree to discover, if possible, if there were any people; but having remained on the top of the tree for a week, and not seeing anybody, they naturally concluded that there were no inhabitants; and accordingly, when they came down, they loaded the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets and a million of chocolate-drops; and these afforded them sustenance for more than a month, during which time they pursued their voyage with the utmost delight and apathy.    after this they came to a shore where there were no less than sixty-five great red parrots with blue tails, sitting on a rail all of a row, and all fast asleep. and i am sorry to say that the pussy-cat and the quangle-wangle crept softly, and bit off the tail-feathers of all the sixty-five parrots; for which violet reproved them both severely.    notwithstanding which, she proceeded to insert all the feathers--two hundred and sixty in number--in her bonnet; thereby causing it to have a lovely and glittering appearance, highly prepossessing and efficacious.    the next thing that happened to them was in a narrow part of the sea, which was so entirely full of fishes that the boat could go on no farther: so they remained there about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly all the fishes, which were soles, and all ready-cooked, and covered with shrimp-sauce, so that there was no trouble whatever. and as the few fishes who remained uneaten complained of the cold, as well as of the difficulty they had in getting any sleep on account of the extreme noise made by the arctic bears and the tropical turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood in great numbers, violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for several of the fishes, and slingsby administered some opium-drops to them; through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.    then they came to a country which was wholly covered with immense orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of fruit. so they all landed, taking with them the tea-kettle, intending to gather some of the oranges, and place them in it. but, while they were busy about this, a most dreadfully high wind rose, and blew out most of the parrot-tail feathers from violet's bonnet. that, however, was nothing compared with the calamity of the oranges falling down on their heads by millions and millions, which thumped and bumped and bumped and thumped them all so seriously, that they were obliged to run as hard as they could for their lives; besides that the sound of the oranges rattling on the tea-kettle was of the most fearful and amazing nature.    nevertheless, they got safely to the boat, although considerably vexed and hurt; and the quangle-wangle's right foot was so knocked about, that he had to sit with his head in his slipper for at least a week.    this event made them all for a time rather melancholy: and perhaps they might never have become less so, had not lionel, with a most praiseworthy devotion and perseverance, continued to stand on one leg, and whistle to them in a loud and lively manner; which diverted the whole party so extremely that they gradually recovered their spirits, and agreed that whenever they should reach home, they would subscribe towards a testimonial to lionel, entirely made of gingerbread and raspberries, as an earnest token of their sincere and grateful infection.    after sailing on calmly for several more days, they came to another country, where they were much pleased and surprised to see a countless multitude of white mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle, slowly eating custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite demeanor.    and as the four travellers were rather hungry, being tired of eating nothing but soles and oranges for so long a period, they held a council as to the propriety of asking the mice for some of their pudding in a humble and affecting manner, by which they could hardly be otherwise than gratified. it was agreed, therefore, that guy should go and ask the mice, which he immediately did; and the result was, that they gave a walnut-shell only half full of custard diluted with water. now, this displeased guy, who said, out of such a lot of pudding as you have got, i must say, you might have spared a somewhat larger quantity. but no sooner had he finished speaking than the mice turned round at once, and sneezed at him in an appalling and vindictive manner (and it is impossible to imagine a more scroobious and unpleasant sound than that caused by the simultaneous sneezing of many millions of angry mice); so that guy rushed back to the boat, having first shied his cap into the middle of the custard-pudding, by which means he completely spoiled the mice's dinner.    by and by the four children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. each of these blue bottles contained a blue-bottle-fly; and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony: nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. violet and slingsby and guy and lionel were greatly struck with this singular and instructive settlement; and, having previously asked permission of the blue-bottle-flies (which was most courteously granted), the boat was drawn up to the shore, and they proceeded to make tea in front of the bottles: but as they had no tea-leaves, they merely placed some pebbles in the hot water; and the quangle-wangle played some tunes over it on an accordion, by which, of course, tea was made directly, and of the very best quality.  the four children then entered into conversation with the blue-bottle-flies, who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they each held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally occasioned a fizzy, extraneous utterance.  why, said violet, would you kindly inform us, do you reside in bottles; and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple, or, indeed, in yellow bottles?  to which questions a very aged blue-bottle-fly answered, we found the bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our great-great-great- great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at once. and, when the winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside down, and consequently rarely feel the cold at all; and you know very well that this could not be the case with bottles of any other color than blue.  of course it could not, said slingsby. but, if we may take the liberty of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?  mainly on oyster-patties, said the blue-bottle-fly; and, when these are scarce, on raspberry vinegar and russian leather boiled down to a jelly.  how delicious! said guy.  to which lionel added, huzz! and all the blue-bottle-flies said, buzz!  at this time, an elderly fly said it was the hour for the evening-song to be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the blue-bottle-flies began to buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner, the melodious and mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters, and resounding across the tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice upon the intervening and verdant mountains with a serene and sickly suavity only known to the truly virtuous. the moon was shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky, while her light irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of the blue-bottle-flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous circumstances.  in many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to that evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was already past midnight when--the sail of the boat having been set up by the quangle-wangle, the tea-kettle and churn placed in their respective positions, and the pussy-cat stationed at the helm--the children each took a last and affectionate farewell of the blue-bottle-flies, who walked down in a body to the water's edge to see the travellers embark.    as a token of parting respect and esteem, violet made a courtesy quite down to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining parrot-tail feathers into the back hair of the most pleasing of the blue-bottle-flies; while slingsby, guy, and lionel offered them three small boxes, containing, respectively, black pins, dried figs, and epsom salts; and thus they left that happy shore forever.  overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly jumped into the tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. but all along the shore, for many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of severely-suppressed sobs, and of a vague multitude of living creatures using their pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous snuffle, lingering sadly along the walloping waves as the boat sailed farther and farther away from the land of the happy blue-bottle-flies.  nothing particular occurred for some days after these events, except that, as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they perceived an unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large number of crabs and crawfish--perhaps six or seven hundred--sitting by the water-side, and endeavoring to disentangle a vast heap of pale pink worsted, which they moistened at intervals with a fluid composed of lavender-water and white-wine negus.  can we be of any service to you, o crusty crabbies? said the four children.  thank you kindly, said the crabs consecutively. we are trying to make some worsted mittens, but do not know how.  on which violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of mitten-making, said to the crabs, do your claws unscrew, or are they fixtures?  they are all made to unscrew, said the crabs; and forthwith they deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which violet uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest mittens with it you can imagine. these the crabs, having resumed and screwed on their claws, placed cheerfully upon their wrists, and walked away rapidly on their hind-legs, warbling songs with a silvery voice and in a minor key.  after this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to a vast and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing whatever could be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked onward, there appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single object, which on a nearer approach, and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig, sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cakes and oyster-shells. it does not quite look like a human being, said violet doubtfully; nor could they make out what it really was, till the quangle-wangle (who had previously been round the world) exclaimed softly in a loud voice, it is the co-operative cauliflower!    and so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the cauliflower; and that he had no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk,--an accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense of stockings and shoes.  presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and, in a somewhat plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the setting sun,--his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers, and a large number of waterwagtails proceeding in advance of him by three and three in a row,--till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand.    so remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.  shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below some high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly odious little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers, and with a pewter plate upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin at the boat, by which it was instantly upset.    but this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party knew how to swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming about till after the moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they sponge-taneously entered the boat. meanwhile the quangle-wangle threw back the pumpkin with immense force, so that it hit the rocks where the malicious little boy in rose-colored knickerbockers was sitting; when, being quite full of lucifer-matches, the pumpkin exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits; whereon the rocks instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became unpleasantly hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were turned quite green, and his nose was burnt off.  two or three days after this had happened, they came to another place, where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep pits full of mulberry-jam. this is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed apes who abound in these districts, and who store up the mulberry-jam for their food in winter, when they mix it with pellucid pale periwinkle-soup, and serve it out in wedgewood china-bowls, which grow freely all over that part of the country. only one of the yellow-nosed apes was on the spot, and he was fast asleep; yet the four travellers and the quangle-wangle and pussy were so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring, that they merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned to re-embark in their boat without delay.  what was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn and the tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous seeze pyder, an aquatic and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and, happily, only met with in those excessive longitudes! in a moment, the beautiful boat was bitten into fifty-five thousand million hundred billion bits; and it instantly became quite clear that violet, slingsby, guy, and lionel could no longer preliminate their voyage by sea.  the four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing their wanderings by land: and, very fortunately, there happened to pass by at that moment an elderly rhinoceros, on which they seized; and, all four mounting on his back,--the quangle-wangle sitting on his horn, and holding on by his ears, and the pussy-cat swinging at the end of his tail,--they set off, having only four small beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes to last through their whole journey.    they were, however, able to catch numbers of the chickens and turkeys and other birds who incessantly alighted on the head of the rhinoceros for the purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew there; and these creatures they cooked in the most translucent and satisfactory manner by means of a fire lighted on the end of the rhinoceros's back. a crowd of kangaroos and gigantic cranes accompanied them, from feelings of curiosity and complacency; so that they were never at a loss for company, and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse and triumphant procession.  thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at home, where they were received by their admiring relatives with joy tempered with contempt, and where they finally resolved to carry out the rest of their travelling-plans at some more favorable opportunity.  as for the rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they had him killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside the door of their father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper.       the history of the seven families of the lake pipple-popple.   chapter i.  introductory.  in former days,--that is to say, once upon a time,--there lived in the land of gramble-blamble seven families. they lived by the side of the great lake pipple-popple (one of the seven families, indeed, lived in the lake), and on the outskirts of the city of tosh, which, excepting when it was quite dark, they could see plainly. the names of all these places you have probably heard of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to find out all about them.  now, the seven families who lived on the borders of the great lake pipple-popple were as follows in the next chapter.   chapter ii.  the seven families.  there was a family of two old parrots and seven young parrots.    there was a family of two old storks and seven young storks.    there was a family of two old geese and seven young geese.    there was a family of two old owls and seven young owls.    there was a family of two old guinea pigs and seven young guinea pigs.    there was a family of two old cats and seven young cats.    and there was a family of two old fishes and seven young fishes.     chapter iii.  the habits of the seven families.  the parrots lived upon the soffsky-poffsky trees, which were beautiful to behold, and covered with blue leaves; and they fed upon fruit, artichokes, and striped beetles.  the storks walked in and out of the lake pipple-popple, and ate frogs for breakfast, and buttered toast for tea; but on account of the extreme length of their legs they could not sit down, and so they walked about continually.  the geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies, which they ate for dinner.  the owls anxiously looked after mice, which they caught, and made into sago-puddings.  the guinea pigs toddled about the gardens, and ate lettuces and cheshire cheese.  the cats sate still in the sunshine, and fed upon sponge biscuits.  the fishes lived in the lake, and fed chiefly on boiled periwinkles.  and all these seven families lived together in the utmost fun and felicity.   chapter iv.  the children of the seven families are sent away.  one day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the seven families agreed that they would send their children out to see the world.  so they called them all together, and gave them each eight shillings and some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small green morocco pocket-book to set down their expenses in.  they then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all the parents sent off their children with a parting injunction.  if, said the old parrots, you find a cherry, do not fight about who should have it.  and, said the old storks, if you find a frog, divide it carefully into seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it.  and the old geese said to the seven young geese, whatever you do, be sure you do not touch a plum-pudding flea.  and the old owls said, if you find a mouse, tear him up into seven slices, and eat him cheerfully, but without quarrelling.  and the old guinea pigs said, have a care that you eat your lettuces, should you find any, not greedily, but calmly.  and the old cats said, be particularly careful not to meddle with a clangle-wangle if you should see one.  and the old fishes said, above all things, avoid eating a blue boss-woss; for they do not agree with fishes, and give them a pain in their toes.  so all the children of each family thanked their parents; and, making in all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide world.    chapter v.  the history of the seven young parrots.  the seven young parrots had not gone far, when they saw a tree with a single cherry on it, which the oldest parrot picked instantly; but the other six, being extremely hungry, tried to get it also. on which all the seven began to fight; and they scuffled,      and huffled,        and ruffled,          and shuffled,            and puffled,              and muffled,                and buffled,                  and duffled,                    and fluffled,                      and guffled,                        and bruffled,                          and screamed, and shrieked, and squealed, and squeaked, and clawed, and snapped, and bit, and bumped, and thumped, and dumped, and flumped each other, till they were all torn into little bits; and at last there was nothing left to record this painful incident except the cherry and seven small green feathers.  and that was the vicious and voluble end of the seven young parrots.     chapter vi.  the history of the seven young storks.  when the seven young storks set out, they walked or flew for fourteen weeks in a straight line, and for six weeks more in a crooked one; and after that they ran as hard as they could for one hundred and eight miles; and after that they stood still, and made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery noise with their bills.  about the same time they perceived a large frog, spotted with green, and with a sky-blue stripe under each ear.  so, being hungry, they immediately flew at him, and were going to divide him into seven pieces, when they began to quarrel as to which of his legs should be taken off first. one said this, and another said that; and while they were all quarrelling, the frog hopped away. and when they saw that he was gone, they began to   chatter-clatter,       blatter-platter,           patter-blatter,               matter-clatter,                   flatter-quatter, more violently than ever; and after they had fought for a week, they pecked each other all to little pieces, so that at last nothing was left of any of them except their bills.  and that was the end of the seven young storks.     chapter vii.  the history of the seven young geese.  when the seven young geese began to travel, they went over a large plain, on which there was but one tree, and that was, a very bad one.  so four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about them; while the other three waddled up and down, and repeated poetry, and their last six lessons in arithmetic, geography, and cookery.  presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most interesting and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body exactly resembling a boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and a beak, and three feathers growing out of his head, and only one leg.  so, after a time, all the seven young geese said to each other, beyond all doubt this beast must be a plum-pudding flea!  on which they incautiously began to sing aloud,         plum-pudding flea,         plum-pudding flea,         wherever you be,         oh! come to our tree,     and listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!  and no sooner had they sung this verse than the plum-pudding flea began to hop and skip on his one leg with the most dreadful velocity, and came straight to the tree, where he stopped, and looked about him in a vacant and voluminous manner.  on which the seven young geese were greatly alarmed, and all of a tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and just touched him with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he done this than the plum-pudding flea skipped and hopped about more and more, and higher and higher; after which he opened his mouth, and, to the great surprise and indignation of the seven geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and terribly, that they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees every one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.  so that was the end of the seven young geese.     chapter viii.  the history of the seven young owls.  when the seven young owls set out, they sate every now and then on the branches of old trees, and never went far at one time.  and one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard a mouse; but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not see him.  so they called out, is that a mouse?  on which a mouse answered, squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!  and immediately all the young owls threw themselves off the tree, meaning to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive that there was a large well below them, into which they all fell superficially, and were every one of them drowned in less than half a minute.  so that was the end of the seven young owls.     chapter ix.  the history of the seven young guinea pigs.  the seven young guinea pigs went into a garden full of goose-berry-bushes and tiggory-trees, under one of which they fell asleep. when they awoke, they saw a large lettuce, which had grown out of the ground while they had been sleeping, and which had an immense number of green leaves. at which they all exclaimed,--     lettuce! o lettuce     let us, o let us,     o lettuce-leaves,     o let us leave this tree, and eat     lettuce, o let us, lettuce-leaves!  and instantly the seven young guinea pigs rushed with such extreme force against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly against its stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient transitional inflammation of their noses, which grew worse and worse and worse and worse, till it incidentally killed them all seven.  and that was the end of the seven young guinea pigs.     chapter x.  the history of the seven young cats.  the seven young cats set off on their travels with great delight and rapacity. but, on coming to the top of a high hill, they perceived at a long distance off a clangle-wangle (or, as it is more properly written, clangel-wangel); and, in spite of the warning they had had, they ran straight up to it.  (now, the clangle-wangle is a most dangerous and delusive beast, and by no means commonly to be met with. they live in the water as well as on land, using their long tail as a sail when in the former element. their speed is extreme; but their habits of life are domestic and superfluous, and their general demeanor pensive and pellucid. on summer evenings, they may sometimes be observed near the lake pipple-popple, standing on their heads, and humming their national melodies. they subsist entirely on vegetables, excepting when they eat veal or mutton or pork or beef or fish or saltpetre.)  the moment the clangle-wangle saw the seven young cats approach, he ran away; and as he ran straight on for four months, and the cats, though they continued to run, could never overtake him, they all gradually died of fatigue and exhaustion, and never afterwards recovered.  and this was the end of the seven young cats.     chapter xi.  the history of the seven young fishes.  the seven young fishes swam across the lake pipple-popple, and into the river, and into the ocean; where, most unhappily for them, they saw, on the fifteenth day of their travels, a bright-blue boss-woss, and instantly swam after him. but the blue boss-woss plunged into a     perpendicular,         spicular,             orbicular,                 quadrangular,                      circular depth of soft mud; where, in fact, his house was.  and the seven young fishes, swimming with great and uncomfortable velocity, plunged also into the mud quite against their will, and, not being accustomed to it, were all suffocated in a very short period.  and that was the end of the seven young fishes.     chapter xii.  of what occurred subsequently.  after it was known that the              seven young parrots,     and the seven young storks,     and the seven young geese,     and the seven young owls,     and the seven young guinea pigs,     and the seven young cats,     and the seven young fishes,  were all dead, then the frog, and the plum-pudding flea, and the mouse, and the clangle-wangle, and the blue boss-woss, all met together to rejoice over their good fortune. and they collected the seven feathers of the seven young parrots, and the seven bills of the seven young storks, and the lettuce, and the cherry; and having placed the latter on the lettuce, and the other objects in a circular arrangement at their base, they danced a hornpipe round all these memorials until they were quite tired; after which they gave a tea-party, and a garden-party, and a ball, and a concert, and then returned to their respective homes full of joy and respect, sympathy, satisfaction, and disgust.     chapter xiii.  of what became of the parents of the forty-nine children.  but when the two old parrots,      and the two old storks,      and the two old geese,      and the two old owls,      and the two old guinea pigs,      and the two old cats,      and the two old fishes,  became aware, by reading in the newspapers, of the calamitous extinction of the whole of their families, they refused all further sustenance; and, sending out to various shops, they purchased great quantities of cayenne pepper and brandy and vinegar and blue sealing-wax, besides seven immense glass bottles with air-tight stoppers. and, having done this, they ate a light supper of brown-bread and jerusalem artichokes, and took an affecting and formal leave of the whole of their acquaintance, which was very numerous and distinguished and select and responsible and ridiculous.   chapter xiv.  conclusion.  and after this they filled the bottles with the ingredients for pickling, and each couple jumped into a separate bottle; by which effort, of course, they all died immediately, and became thoroughly pickled in a few minutes; having previously made their wills (by the assistance of the most eminent lawyers of the district), in which they left strict orders that the stoppers of the seven bottles should be carefully sealed up with the blue sealing-wax they had purchased; and that they themselves, in the bottles, should be presented to the principal museum of the city of tosh, to be labelled with parchment or any other anti-congenial succedaneum, and to be placed on a marble table with silver-gilt legs, for the daily inspection and contemplation, and for the perpetual benefit, of the pusillanimous public.  and if you ever happen to go to gramble-blamble, and visit that museum in the city of tosh, look for them on the ninety-eighth table in the four hundred and twenty-seventh room of the right-hand corridor of the left wing of the central quadrangle of that magnificent building; for, if you do not, you certainly will not see them.                                                                 nonsense cookery.  extract from the nonsense gazette, for august, 1870.  our readers will be interested in the following communications from our valued and learned contributor, prof. bosh, whose labors in the fields of culinary and botanical science are so well known to all the world. the first three articles richly merit to be added to the domestic cookery of every family: those which follow claim the attention of all botanists; and we are happy to be able, through dr. bosh's kindness, to present our readers with illustrations of his discoveries. all the new flowers are found in the valley of verrikwier, near the lake of oddgrow, and on the summit of the hill orfeltugg.    three receipts for domestic cookery.   to make an amblongus pie.  take 4 pounds (say 4-1/2 pounds) of fresh amblongusses, and put them in a small pipkin.  cover them with water, and boil them for 8 hours incessantly; after which add 2 pints of new milk, and proceed to boil for 4 hours more.  when you have ascertained that the amblongusses are quite soft, take them out, and place them in a wide pan, taking care to shake them well previously.  grate some nutmeg over the surface, and cover them carefully with powdered gingerbread, curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity of cayenne pepper.  remove the pan into the next room, and place it on the floor. bring it back again, and let it simmer for three-quarters of an hour. shake the pan violently till all the amblongusses have become of a pale purple color.  then, having prepared the paste, insert the whole carefully; adding at the same time a small pigeon, 2 slices of beef, 4 cauliflowers, and any number of oysters.  watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of salt from time to time.  serve up in a clean dish, and throw the whole out of window as fast as possible.   to make crumbobblious cutlets.  procure some strips of beef, and, having cut them into the smallest possible slices, proceed to cut them still smaller,--eight, or perhaps nine times.  when the whole is thus minced, brush it up hastily with a new clothes-brush, and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon or a soup-ladle.  place the whole in a saucepan, and remove it to a sunny place,--say the roof of the house, if free from sparrows or other birds,--and leave it there for about a week.  at the end of that time add a little lavender, some oil of almonds, and a few herring-bones;

and in that case the pig may be let loose, and the whole process may be considered as finished.                                              nonsense botany.

 (the ladies looked puzzled, as indeed was i, the author.)  do you not know who is the writer of it? asked the gentleman.  the name is 'edward lear,' said one of the ladies.  ah! said the first speaker, so it is printed; but that is only a whim of the real author, the earl of derby. 'edward' is his christian name, and, as you may see, lear is only earl transposed.  but, said the lady, doubtingly, here is a dedication to the great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces of edward, thirteenth earl of derby, by the author, edward lear.  that, replied the other, is simply a piece of mystification; i am in a position to know that the whole book was composed and illustrated by lord derby himself. in fact, there is no such a person at all as edward lear.  yet, said the other lady, some friends of mine tell me they know mr. lear.  quite a mistake! completely a mistake! said the old gentleman, becoming rather angry at the contradiction; i am well aware of what i am saying: i can inform you, no such a person as 'edward lear' exists!  hitherto i had kept silence; but as my hat was, as well as my handkerchief and stick, largely marked inside with my name, and as i happened to have in my pocket several letters addressed to me, the temptation was too great to resist; so, flashing all these articles at once on my would-be extinguisher's attention, i speedily reduced him to silence.  the second volume of nonsense, commencing with the verses, the owl and the pussy-cat, was written at different times, and for different sets of children: the whole being collected in the course of last year, were then illustrated, and published in a single volume, by mr. r.j. bush, of 32 charing cross.  the contents of the third or present volume were made also at different intervals in the last two years.  long years ago, in days when much of my time was passed in a country house, where children and mirth abounded, the lines beginning, there was an old man of tobago, were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse lending itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures; and thenceforth the greater part of the original drawings and verses for the first book of nonsense were struck off with a pen, no assistance ever having been given me in any way but that of uproarious delight and welcome at the appearance of every new absurdity.  most of these drawings and rhymes were transferred to lithographic stones in the year 1846, and were then first published by mr. thomas mclean, of the haymarket. but that edition having been soon exhausted, and the call for the book of nonsense continuing, i added a considerable number of subjects to those previously-published, and having caused the whole to be carefully reproduced in woodcuts by messrs. dalzell, i disposed of the copyright to messrs. routledge and warne, by whom the volume was published in 1843.                                                               edward lear.  villa emily, san remo, august, 1871.                                              nonsense botany.

the dong!       the wandering dong through the forest goes!         the dong! the dong!       the dong with a luminous nose!          long years ago       the dong was happy and gay,     till he fell in love with a jumbly girl       who came to those shores one day.     for the jumblies came in a sieve, they did,--     landing at eve near the zemmery fidd         where the oblong oysters grow,       and the rocks are smooth and gray.     and all the woods and the valleys rang     with the chorus they daily and nightly sang,--         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live;           their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.      happily, happily passed those days!       while the cheerful jumblies staid;         they danced in circlets all night long,         to the plaintive pipe of the lively dong,       in moonlight, shine, or shade.     for day and night he was always there     by the side of the jumbly girl so fair,     with her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;     till the morning came of that hateful day     when the jumblies sailed in their sieve away,     and the dong was left on the cruel shore     gazing, gazing for evermore,--     ever keeping his weary eyes on     that pea-green sail on the far horizon,--     singing the jumbly chorus still     as he sate all day on the grassy hill,--         far and few, far and few,           are the lands where the jumblies live;           their heads are green, and their hands are blue,           and they went to sea in a sieve.      but when the sun was low in the west,         the dong arose and said,--     what little sense i once possessed         has quite gone out of my head!     and since that day he wanders still     by lake and forest, marsh and hill,     singing, o somewhere, in valley or plain,     might i find my jumbly girl again!     for ever i'll seek by lake and shore     till i find my jumbly girl once more!          playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,         since then his jumbly girl he seeks;         and because by night he could not see,         he gathered the bark of the twangum tree           on the flowery plain that grows.           and he wove him a wondrous nose,--         a nose as strange as a nose could be!      of vast proportions and painted red,     and tied with cords to the back of his head.         in a hollow rounded space it ended         with a luminous lamp within suspended,             all fenced about             with a bandage stout             to prevent the wind from blowing it out;         and with holes all round to send the light         in gleaming rays on the dismal night      and now each night, and all night long,     over those plains still roams the dong;     and above the wail of the chimp and snipe     you may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,     while ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,     to meet with his jumbly girl again;     lonely and wild, all night he goes,--     the dong with a luminous nose!     and all who watch at the midnight hour,     from hall or terrace or lofty tower,     cry, as they trace the meteor bright,     moving along through the dreary night,--        this is the hour when forth he goes,         the dong with a luminous nose!         yonder, over the plain he goes,--             he goes!             he goes,--         the dong with a luminous nose!     the two old bachelors.    two old bachelors were living in one house; one caught a muffin, the other caught a mouse. said he who caught the muffin to him who caught the mouse,-- this happens just in time! for we've nothing in the house, save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey, and what to do for dinner--since we haven't any money? and what can we expect if we haven't any dinner, but to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?  said he who caught the mouse to him who caught the muffin,-- we might cook this little mouse, if we only had some stuffin'! if we had but sage and onion we could do extremely well; but how to get that stuffin' it is difficult to tell!  those two old bachelors ran quickly to the town and asked for sage and onion as they wandered up and down; they borrowed two large onions, but no sage was to be found in the shops, or in the market, or in all the gardens round.  but some one said, a hill there is, a little to the north, and to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth; and there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient sage,-- an earnest man, who reads all day a most perplexing page. climb up, and seize him by the toes,--all studious as he sits,-- and pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits! then mix him with your onion (cut up likewise into scraps),-- when your stuffin' will be ready, and very good--perhaps.  those two old bachelors without loss of time the nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb; and at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook, they saw that sage a-reading of a most enormous book.  you earnest sage! aloud they cried, your book you've read enough in! we wish to chop you into bits to mix you into stuffin'!  but that old sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book, at those two bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took; and over crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,-- at once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town; and when they reached their house, they found (besides their want                                                           of stuffin'), the mouse had fled--and, previously, had eaten up the muffin.  they left their home in silence by the once convivial door; and from that hour those bachelors were never heard of more.   [illustration: sheet music--the pelicans]      the pelican chorus.      king and queen of the pelicans we;      no other birds so grand we see!     none but we have feet like fins!     with lovely leathery throats and chins!         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still      we live on the nile. the nile we love.     by night we sleep on the cliffs above;     by day we fish, and at eve we stand     on long bare islands of yellow sand.     and when the sun sinks slowly down,     and the great rock walls grow dark and brown,      where the purple river rolls fast and dim     and the ivory ibis starlike skim,     wing to wing we dance around,     stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,     opening our mouths as pelicans ought;     and this is the song we nightly snort,--         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      last year came out our daughter dell,     and all the birds received her well.     to do her honor a feast we made     for every bird that can swim or wade,--     herons and gulls, and cormorants black,     cranes, and flamingoes with scarlet back,     plovers and storks, and geese in clouds,     swans and dilberry ducks in crowds:     thousands of birds in wondrous flight!     they ate and drank and danced all night,     and echoing back from the rocks you heard     multitude-echoes from bird and bird,--         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      yes, they came; and among the rest     the king of the cranes all grandly dressed.     such a lovely tail! its feathers float     between the ends of his blue dress-coat;     with pea-green trowsers all so neat,     and a delicate frill to hide his feet     (for though no one speaks of it, every one knows     he has got no webs between his toes).      as soon as he saw our daughter dell,     in violent love that crane king fell,--     on seeing her waddling form so fair,     with a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.     and before the end of the next long day     our dell had given her heart away;     for the king of the cranes had won that heart     with a crocodile's egg and a large fish-tart.     she vowed to marry the king of the cranes,     leaving the nile for stranger plains;     and away they flew in a gathering crowd     of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!      and far away in the twilight sky     we heard them singing a lessening cry,--     farther and farther, till out of sight,     and we stood alone in the silent night!     often since, in the nights of june,     we sit on the sand and watch the moon,--      she has gone to the great gromboolian plain,     and we probably never shall meet again!     oft, in the long still nights of june,     we sit on the rocks and watch the moon,--     she dwells by the streams of the chankly bore.     and we probably never shall see her more.         ploffskin, pluffskin, pelican jee!         we think no birds so happy as we!         plumpskin, ploshkin, pelican jill!         we think so then, and we thought so still!

    and his aunt jobiska made him drink     lavender water tinged with pink;     for she said, the world in general knows     there's nothing so good for a pobble's toes!                       ii.      the pobble who has no toes,         swam across the bristol channel;     but before he set out he wrapped his nose         in a piece of scarlet flannel.     for his aunt jobiska said, no harm     can come to his toes if his nose is warm;     and it's perfectly known that a pobble's toes     are safe--provided he minds his nose.                       iii.      the pobble swam fast and well,         and when boats or ships came near him,     he tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell         so that all the world could hear him.     and all the sailors and admirals cried,     when they saw him nearing the further side,--    he has gone to fish, for his aunt jobiska's     runcible cat with crimson whiskers!                       iv.      but before he touched the shore,--         the shore of the bristol channel,     a sea-green porpoise carried away         his wrapper of scarlet flannel.     and when he came to observe his feet,     formerly garnished with toes so neat,     his face at once became forlorn     on perceiving that all his toes were gone!                       v.      and nobody ever knew,         from that dark day to the present,     whoso had taken the pobble's toes,         in a manner so far from pleasant.     whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,     or crafty mermaids stole them away,     nobody knew; and nobody knows     how the pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!                       vi.      the pobble who has no toes         was placed in a friendly bark,     and they rowed him back, and carried him up         to his aunt jobiska's park.     and she made him a feast, at his earnest wish,     of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;     and she said, it's a fact the whole world knows,     that pobbles are happier without their toes.     the new vestments.      there lived an old man in the kingdom of tess,     who invented a purely original dress;     and when it was perfectly made and complete,     he opened the door and walked into the street.      by way of a hat he'd a loaf of brown bread,     in the middle of which he inserted his head;     his shirt was made up of no end of dead mice,     the warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;     his drawers were of rabbit-skins, so were his shoes;     his stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;     his waistcoat and trowsers were made of pork chops;     his buttons were jujubes and chocolate drops;     his coat was all pancakes, with jam for a border,     and a girdle of biscuits to keep it in order;     and he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,     a cloak of green cabbage-leaves stitched all together.      he had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,     of all sorts of beasticles, birdlings, and boys;     and from every long street and dark lane in the town     beasts, birdies, and boys in a tumult rushed down.     two cows and a calf ate his cabbage-leaf cloak;     four apes seized his girdle, which vanished like smoke;     three kids ate up half of his pancaky coat,     and the tails were devour'd by an ancient he goat;     an army of dogs in a twinkling tore up his     pork waistcoat and trowsers to give to their puppies;     and while they were growling, and mumbling the chops,     ten boys prigged the jujubes and chocolate drops.     he tried to run back to his house, but in vain,     for scores of fat pigs came again and again:     they rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;     they tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;     and now from the housetops with screechings descend     striped, spotted, white, black, and gray cats without end:     they jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,     when crows, ducks, and hens made a mincemeat of that;     they speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,     and utterly tore up his shirt of dead mice;     they swallowed the last of his shirt with a squall,--     whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.      and he said to himself, as he bolted the door,    i will not wear a similar dress any more,     any more, any more, any more, never more!     mr. and mrs. discobbolos.                      i.      mr. and mrs. discobbolos         climbed to the top of a wall.       and they sate to watch the sunset sky,       and to hear the nupiter piffkin cry,         and the biscuit buffalo call.     they took up a roll and some camomile tea,     and both were as happy as happy could be,             till mrs. discobbolos said,--            oh! w! x! y! z!             it has just come into my head,       suppose we should happen to fall!!!!!                         darling mr. discobbolos!                       ii.     suppose we should fall down flumpetty,         just like pieces of stone,       on to the thorns, or into the moat,       what would become of your new green coat?         and might you not break a bone?     it never occurred to me before,     that perhaps we shall never go down any more!             and mrs. discobbolos said,            oh! w! x! y! z!             what put it into your head       to climb up this wall, my own                         darling mr. discobbolos?                       iii.      mr. discobbolos answered,        at first it gave me pain,       and i felt my ears turn perfectly pink       when your exclamation made me think         we might never get down again!     but now i believe it is wiser far     to remain for ever just where we are.             and mr. discobbolos said,            oh! w! x! y! z!             it has just come into my head       we shall never go down again,                         dearest mrs. discobbolos!                       iv.      so mr. and mrs. discobbolos         stood up and began to sing,--      far away from hurry and strife       here we will pass the rest of life,         ding a dong, ding dong, ding!     we want no knives nor forks nor chairs,     no tables nor carpets nor household cares;             from worry of life we've fled;             oh! w! x! y! z!             there is no more trouble ahead,       sorrow or any such thing,                         for mr. and mrs. discobbolos!     the quangle wangle's hat.                        i.      on the top of the crumpetty tree         the quangle wangle sat,     but his face you could not see,         on account of his beaver hat.     for his hat was a hundred and two feet wide,     with ribbons and bibbons on every side,     and bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,     so that nobody ever could see the face             of the quangle wangle quee.                       ii.      the quangle wangle said         to himself on the crumpetty tree,     jam, and jelly, and bread         are the best of food for me!     but the longer i live on this crumpetty tree     the plainer than ever it seems to me     that very few people come this way     and that life on the whole is far from gay!             said the quangle wangle quee.                       iii.      but there came to the crumpetty tree         mr. and mrs. canary;     and they said, did ever you see         any spot so charmingly airy?     may we build a nest on your lovely hat?     mr. quangle wangle, grant us that!     o please let us come and build a nest     of whatever material suits you best,             mr. quangle wangle quee!                       iv.      and besides, to the crumpetty tree         came the stork, the duck, and the owl;     the snail and the bumble-bee,         the frog and the fimble fowl     (the fimble fowl, with a corkscrew leg);     and all of them said, we humbly beg     we may build our homes on your lovely hat,--     mr. quangle wangle, grant us that!        mr. quangle wangle quee!                       v.      and the golden grouse came there,         and the pobble who has no toes,     and the small olympian bear,         and the dong with a luminous nose.     and the blue baboon who played the flute,     and the orient calf from the land of tute,     and the attery squash, and the bisky bat,--     all came and built on the lovely hat       of the quangle wangle quee.                      vi.      and the quangle wangle said         to himself on the crumpetty tree,     when all these creatures move         what a wonderful noise there'll be!     and at night by the light of the mulberry moon     they danced to the flute of the blue baboon,     on the broad green leaves of the crumpetty tree,     and all were as happy as happy could be,       with the quangle wangle quee.     the cummerbund. an indian poem.                      i.  she sate upon her dobie,     to watch the evening star, and all the punkahs, as they passed,     cried, my! how fair you are! around her bower, with quivering leaves,     the tall kamsamahs grew, and kitmutgars in wild festoons     hung down from tchokis blue.                       ii.  below her home the river rolled     with soft meloobious sound, where golden-finned chuprassies swam,     in myriads circling round. above, on tallest trees remote     green ayahs perched alone, and all night long the mussak moan'd     its melancholy tone.                       iii.  and where the purple nullahs threw     their branches far and wide, and silvery goreewallahs flew     in silence, side by side, the little bheesties' twittering cry     rose on the flagrant air, and oft the angry jampan howled     deep in his hateful lair.                       iv.  she sate upon her dobie,     she heard the nimmak hum, when all at once a cry arose,     the cummerbund is come! in vain she fled: with open jaws     the angry monster followed, and so (before assistance came)     that lady fair was swollowed.                       v.  they sought in vain for even a bone     respectfully to bury; they said, hers was a dreadful fate!
